Yeah, yeah he is so.
What's a pedophile?
Did he ever do this? How about this? 
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
Yeah? 
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
Going away party? What do you mean?
Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
Well he is.
Where's the going-away party?
At Cartman's house.
Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. 
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
Yeah. You're right. 
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
The hell is that? 
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
Butters, are you there?!
I'm here, Eric.
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
No, the last one.
Bill Clinton.
Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 
Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
Kill your mom?
To victory!
I don't play World of Warcraft.
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-
Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! 
What's a urinal?
...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 
Hey, fellas!
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
Where did you hear that?
From Eric.
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
What? People see the truth?
Can I go now?
Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 
Waaaah! 
Ike made a nuno.
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
Hands?! Let me see those hands!
Haaaah!
Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
It's, it's... I just had it! 
Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
Huh?
Here, you need a smoke, brah?
Uhh, okay. 
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
I do. 
I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?
Ehthat was pretty good.
I am not!
Then do it, if you're not yellow! 
Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up.
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  
What the fuck is THIS?!
AAAAH! 
Hey! 
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!
You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!
AAAAAAAAAAH! 
You punkass fool!
Haaaah.
Why'd you summon me?
P-please don't ice me, homie?
You'd better have a good reason, sucka!
I just... w-was seein' if it works.
Damn! Every Halloween I gots tuh deal with this shit! I'm in hell, mindin' my own business, and the next thing I know, I'm in some kid's bafroom.
I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls.
You don't understand, fool! I ain't missin' the party!
W-what party?
I already got my wristband, see?  You've got to get me to Los Angeles!
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
How, punk?! We don't use money in her, nigga!
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
This is your fault, homie! You've gots to get me to that party in L.A., or i'm gonna smoke your ass!
Oh hamburgers!
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
Yo dawg, keep it down.
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
But I am. Throwing people out, making a big entrance, having these stupid pictures of me all over. Halloween is supposed to be for everyone. Everybody, I'm sorry. This party is for you. It's for all of you who make my life so special. If I don't realize that, then I'm no better than a rich American teenage girl.  Open the doors! Let everyone in, wristband or no! 
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
What the-?
Thanks. 
I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party.
Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.
And it's not too late. Hey, why don't you come in with me?
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.
Oh boy!
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
Go where?
You're gonna help me freeze myself.
Okay. 
Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
Yeah...I guess it is...
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.
All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
Oh jeez! 
OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!! 
Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!
Pehpew Pehpew! 
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?
Who, me?
It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
No ma'am.
Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! 
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
Okay.
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
...Yeah.
Well, like what?
...Like, you die.
...Die??
Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.
Oh hamburgers!! 
You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
He told me to!
He's dead for sure.
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
Oh my God...
Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!
Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!
What??
Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! 
But I just did what he told me!
Come on, we have to leave!!
Oh jumping Jesus! 
What an asshole!
Hello? 
Butters? Butters!
Eric? Iiis that you?
Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!
Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!
But...  but you're here right now. 
No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!
Huh??
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
Oh, all right then.
Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?
A midget?
No!
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
Hey, fellas! 
Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
Yeah Kyle?
Kyyyle!
Uh what do you mean?
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
Hrrugh! 
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
...Idiot.
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
Butters.
Whoa, hey Eric.
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
A surprise? What is it?
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
Oh boy!
You ready?
Y-yeah!
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
Oh, okay! 
Hang on a second here. 
How come uh, I can't see?
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
Oh uh, ho yeah.
All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
Well okay!
Uh! 
Whoa! Hey Dad! 
Butters! What are you doing?!
I'm getting a surprise! 
Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! 
Hey. Where'd Eric go?
Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?
Like what?
Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.
What's... bi-curious?
What's going on, you two?
Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. 
Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?
...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.
Really?
A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
Whoa boy! Camp!
Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?
Because I'm bi-curious?
Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
I'm bi-curious.
We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.
He's bi-curious too?
You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
Well sure, I guess.
And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
Well yeah, sure.
You know this is strictly forbidden!
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
What's wrong?!  This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!
Yes, it's all very confusing!
You, you will?
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.
Awww, that's okay, Bradley.
I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great.  Oh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!
Wuh-what's the matter?
I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.
Well I like you too, Bradley.
You do?
Well yeah!
You like like me?
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! 
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.
Oh no, my Dad?
Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
It's too late.
Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
Yeah.
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.
No. I like bein' bi-curious.
Well you know somethin'? So do I. 
Wait. Now I am confused.
All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. 
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
Yeah! Dumb girls!
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
Heh hey guys, what would I do?
All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
I thought I was the only one.
Me too.
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
Now you go, Baahir. 
All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
Sure, okay. 
Well all right! 
Oh, snap. 
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
Uuugh! 
Oh hey Eric.
Leave me alone!  Upta!
Hey, I was about to win!
Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! 
Awwwww.
Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called "Les Bos" where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we...  scissored all night long.
You have to be careful with scissors.
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
Uh hey Eric!
Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
Wuh who are you talking about?
Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
This is faggot. Go ahead.
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
Wow.
Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.
Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?
Ubeuh... uh... n... no?
Ah, all right then.
Come on, guys. 
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
Quickly boys! Get on my back! 
Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!
Butters.
Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 
Dude! 
Hey guys!
Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
Who are you?...
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!
Uh what's the Barrier?
Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!
Waaahaa!
No! Noooo! 
Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
That was your plan to stop them??
Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
Hold on, fellas!
Butters, time for breakfast.
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.
Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.
Huh?
Hey, wake up, stupid!  Come on, wake up, kid!
No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out! 
Oh hamburgers! 
Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home! 
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.
Really?
All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!
How much further to Castle Sunshine?
Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been. 
What was that?
Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons! 
Wait! Waaait! 
And what imaginary character are you?
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon,  must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number,  but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy.  Only you can help us win this battle.
Wuh, what can I do?
Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
What powers? Ah I don't understand.
You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.
I c-I can?
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
How?
You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
Butters!  You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!  Grounded!
AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 
What are you doing?! We need Santa!
I'm trying!
BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
GAA HAA!
There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
Santa. Saaanta.
Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.
Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 
Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
Huwhoa! 
Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest! 
Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!
What?
Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
The Chosen One?
Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
Hey, what is that?
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Kyle!
Fellas! Where'd you come from? 
What is that? 
Huh... 
Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
Well I just... used my imagination.
Butters?  Butters!
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
Come on, Butters, time to get up. 
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
You are grounded, mister!
Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.
Oh yes you are!
Oh yeah? 
That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! 
Ahhh shit.
Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Game over! You suck! 
They're gonna do it!
Ohoh, I love this song. 
Wow wee, look at him go!
...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
Uh ohhh.
Dude, what's the matter with him?
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
What?
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!
They're gonna do it! 
Butters, you wanna play me next? 
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
Dude, Butters, calm down.
Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
So who do they say is the cutest?
I donno.
Who do they say is the ugliest?
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail" 
Neato!
At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
O-kay!
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
They sure don't.
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time." When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
I'm number two? Wow.
Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
Way to go, champ.
Whoopie! 
What's goin' on? 
Hey ugly! 
Oh, not much, just hanging around-
Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
...What?
Oh no.
...No. Way.
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
Great benefit, Eric!
Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
Wow, you really know what you're doing.
We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch!  Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
Man...
That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! 
Aw, poor girl.
Sweet!
Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
Butters, don't be such a pussy.
Hokay. 
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
You are?
Not me! I'm a squirrel!
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
NO! 
You killed her! 
Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
(Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
Kenny!
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
Yippie!
It's the Terrance and Phillip Show.  Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees. 
Aww, this one again?!
Not as fat as your face!
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
Wait. I've got it.
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
Oh my.
I said what what? In the butt

Chocolate Raaain.
Aaah. 
Hey, I know you. You're the "What What (In My Asshole)" kid.
"What What (In The Butt)," sir.
So, how many people have seen your Internet video?
Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Me too!
It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man
Are we gonna get tested on this?
My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. 
Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.
I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 
Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!
Your teacher's penis?
Yeah, that must be his.
Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?
Huh?
Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
I understand. 
You can let go now, Butters.
No.
Butters, come on!
No! 
Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. 
Do you see any Indians?
Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  "Super... Phun Thyme."  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Fine, then let go of my hand!
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
I'm not lettin' go!
Fine, then you're comin' with me!
No, Eric! 
Butters, let go God-damn it!
No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
Well, that's your problem!
All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
Make that two! 
Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?
NO! 
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
What are you whoofelin' at? 
Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
Whoa! 
Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Aw, just a few more things.
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
What?! They called the cops?!
They must have realized we left. Damn.
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
Shhh! Butters!
We're gonna get it now!
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
You just got me busted forever!
Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
No! 
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
No.
Butters?
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Sector Bravo, no activity.
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
That looks dangerous.
Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
Oh gosh in heaven.
It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
Whoa!
Save me!
I'm gonna fall! 
(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
Huh... 
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
Let's do it!
Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
Yeah, it sure has.
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
Been a hoot all right!
Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now!  Let go of each other!
Huh uh.
Do what I tell you!
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
Now!
No! 
Jesus Christ! 
AAAAH!
Hey look. 
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
God damn it.
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
There you are, Butters!
Uhuh, Eric.
Butters, I need your help.
Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
The Chinese?
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
Why are they gonna kill my parents?
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
I don't want my parents to die.
So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
Well sure.
You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
Yeah,  fuck 'em.
We can't help him now.
Well I thought it was pretty good.
All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.
Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
Uhh welcome to P.F. Chang's. I'll be right with you. 
Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
What?
Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.
Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
Yeah.
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
Stay calm, Eric.
They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
Herro, prease.
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
Fing fong ting tong.
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
Okay, okay.
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
Huh, invasion pran.
Oh my God...
We're busted! Uh what do we do??
Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
A gun?
Hold the gun on them Butters!
I don't want a gun, Eric!
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
Oh jeez...
Shoot him, Butters!
No!
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
Waah! 
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
Huh?
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Uhwhat?
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
What? What happened? 
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
Aw, I did it again?
What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
Well okay, I'm sorry!
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
Good! Did you kill him? 
Uh, not exactly.
Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh. 
Well it's not where I aimed, honest.
Dude...
I seriously didn't mean it.
Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
By, by my, by myself?
I love you too. 
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
You're gonna  fucking die! 
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
Did she just call us emos?
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
I'll bet she is!
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. 
Almost time. 
Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
Huh.
Ahhh, sweet.
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
What?! That's ridiculous!
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Huh?
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
I can't!  God damn it!
She chickened out!
Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!
She's coming! She's coming!
Butters, get out of here!
But Wendy's coming to fight you.
Oh boy here we go!
All right! 
Ohhhhh!
Fuck him up, Wendy!
No, it's true. We've always hated you.
Well yeah.
All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
Hello, heh.
Looosers!
We lost?
No no! Noo nooo!
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
Who the hell is that?
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
Awww. 
Awww jeez, you're no fun. 
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 
Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 
Who's the male lead?
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
Dude, what?
There's vampires in the school!
What?
Vampires. I've seen them.
Not a cheat if you rank up.
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
Really? Do you think that's best?
Yeah, now get out of here.
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
You can't; it's too close to Vampir. 
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like the sparkles I got?
Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
Hehyeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. 
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
Ummm, what are you doing?
Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
All right, Count Fagula, you just do that. 
Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
Oh no, what did I do this time?
You just march on in there.
Oh Jeez...
You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!
I have no idea, sir.
I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
What keeps a family together, Butters?!
A well-organized pantry.
That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
What is that kid doing?
Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
So?
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
What?
Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
You're not cool enough to be one of us.
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
Yes! Yes, anything else?
I want some Cheetos.
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?
Yeah, I guess.
Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.
Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself. 
Whoa.
And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done. 
Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 
Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! 
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
Butters? 
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
Butters?  Butters?! 
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
You all right, sweetie?
U-huh.  Ow.
Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?
Hey Dad. 
AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
Get away, douchebag.
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
What are you talking about?
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
What the hell are they doing??
They're putting an end to it! 
AAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
Mom, Dad!  I changed back!
What?
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
What's that, Dad?
Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!
Uh oh.
Butters, you are grounded!
Ahh, dangit! 
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
What?
Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
Um, does Kenny like her?
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
Oh, no. Oh, geez!
Butters, what's the problem?
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
What?!
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
All right, come on, guys. 
Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
Uh, what's that?
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
Hi, Grandma!
Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
Well Eric did. 
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
What day?
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
Oh boy!
This is gonna be great!
I've been waiting for this all week.
Oh boy!
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times! 
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
What happened?
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Yes, that's good.
Robbed us of our innocence... 
What? 
Oh God, oh my God no! 
What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 
Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 
Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
Oh. Hey fellas.
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
Aw thanks.
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
My, my picture?
Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
What's going on?
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
What are you?
A gay fish? 
It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 
Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
What was that? 
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
We can?
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
Whoa.
And for lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving taco salad or hoagie sandwiches. Thank you.
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
Yeah!
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
Neato!
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! 
Pirates ho! 
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
What?!
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
Huh, who, you mean you?
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
No, I'm sick of it!
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
He's right, lads. To adventure!
This is Somalia?
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.
Uhh,  mahjey burazi?
Buradi wakuwasa.
Oh. He-he says they're in there. 
Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
ARRRRRRGH!
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
Okay! 
"Scoundrels! You will pay for this!"
Have a good day! 
Hard to port!
What's "port"?!
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
Ey excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
Why did you Americans come here?
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
Yeah, homework.
And our parents hollered at us!
Yeah.
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
But that's not what I do not understand. Why would anyone "want" to be a pirate?
Huh?
Oh my God. 
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
I feel, like an asshole.
Yeah, me too.
"It's starting to look that way."
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
What?!
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." Come on, dude, "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." 
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
Alright, your turn Craig.
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
Uugh!
So what?
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
Sellin' kisses?
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
Uh, how come?
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.
I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.
Hey. 
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
Okay, cool.
Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 
So you got money?
Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
All right, you ready? 
Thank you! 
Good job, Butters!
Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
She'll kiss anybody?
Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.
Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.
Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
What?
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding.
We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
Got it.
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
(Stacey Anderson?) 
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Butters, you're the one doing all this?
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
...A pimp. Huh...
Oh. 
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
You? You be pimpin?
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game.
What's the game?
The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your "bottom bitch." That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?
I know what you're saying.
Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
There you are, Butters!
Hey Dad!
Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson?
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
Aaaaaaah.
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
So wait, you're keeping all the money now?
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.
What?
Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
What?!
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
Shut up!
Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
Leave me alone.
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Butters. Dude!
What?
You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
Dude, we've created a monster.
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
Butters, I really think we should talk.
Sure, Kyle.
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
Butters, what's happened to you?
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. 
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
Did I do good, Daddy?
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
Thank you, Daddy. 
Mmmwhoa boy!
And exactly what kind of business are you running?
It's a kissing company.
And you're making a profit?
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
Do you keep any record of the men getting these "kisses"?
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
Senator Morris?
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
Where?
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
Alright, get out of here! 
Huh? Why?
I'm not falling for it!
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Eh no sir.
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
Fair is fair, ho.
Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!
Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
Yolanda!  Yolanda!
What's that?
It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
Oh Keshawn! 
Wha? Awww.
Promise, babe. Promise.
Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 
Whoa... 
Yes! Yehhehehes!
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah!
Let's do this!
Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
Triceratops!
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
Okey doke.
Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
We'll see about that!
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
Yeah!
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
No way!
I can't believe it's him.
I'm freaking out...
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
For the good of real wrassling. 
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
Awwwww!
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits
Are you sure?
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
Really?  People who are doing something?
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
Ni-nice, okay.
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
What?
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
It does?
Yes, now get out of here.
Okay. 
I don't either.
That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
Who is this little fag?
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
Oh jeez!
I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
Is what true?
That you hate Smurfs?
I don't have time for this.
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
It is true!
Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
"To Douglas." There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
Hey Eric!
Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
Cool, thanks.
That'll be five dollars.
Oh, okay. 
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
Whoa... 
And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
I can no longer stand idly by.
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
Yeah!
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
Woo on!
We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 
Get her good!
I am.
Hey, what are you doing?
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
What the hell? 
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
Ohhh, he's got her now!
If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 
She's speechless!
And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
Okay, go ahead. 
Okay, thanks. 
All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
You said "go ahead".
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
You bet!
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
The who?
I'm gonna go on the slides.
Whoopie! 
If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. 
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.
Come on, Kyle!
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
Do you need to wash your hands?
No.
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
Just drink the pee, Kyle.
Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.
You can do it, Kyle!
All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a 
Hey look! 
Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
Hawww, you lived?
All right everyone, quick! Here you go!
What's this?
Jesus, dude.
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
Okay, very good.  Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
Very good, turn your answers over please. 
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
What?!
Oh no!
Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
(Really??)
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
Butters! Butters, stop it!
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
No! Butters, stop! 
Haah! Leave me alone! 
Sorry...
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
I heard that.
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
John Lennon's dead, Butters.
Aww. Dangit. 
Butters, what are you up to?
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
I am?
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
Oh no. Which book was that?
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
Butters? Is that true?
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
Huh?
Yeah, it's really amazing.
Oh, thanks.
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
I wrote that. 
Amazing book, Butters. 
Thank you! 
You've changed my life, young man.
That's nice. 
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
But, you told me I did!
He's so brooding and full of angst.
Yeah, I'm broooding.
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.
I have to come right to my room after school.
Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's  Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.
Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.
Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
I know.
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
What?
You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
What?! Oh no!
Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
Randy Marsh is at work right now. Work is boring.
Butters Stotch is enjoying Stan's chat party.
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 
How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 
The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay?
Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish.
You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
All right. All right, I'll go.
You will?
Butters.
Hey Eric.
Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
Ahhh well oh- kay.
But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
Get really psyched up, Butters!
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
NASCA- NASCAR?
I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
You're givin' away all your money??
Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
You sure you want to do this?
(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.
Hey Eric.
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater. 
Feel stupid yet?
Fucking gross!
All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
"Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."
Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
No, you're good. 
Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
Really?
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
That was fast.
We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300. 
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
What?
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
Eric, are you sure you can do this?
Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
What's that?
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Oh, fuck my ass! 
Eric?
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back.
How bad is it, doctor?
He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a lever 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.
Well at least there's that.
No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake! 
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
You seemed really stupid, Eric.
Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this "Obama" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
Obama's fuckin' gay.
He's fuckin' gay as hell!
Pissin' me off!
That means you flip the switch that says "Engine."  Is he stupid or what?
Yeah, he's a champion alright.
Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day,  Every. Day.  Every. Day.  And available nationwide.
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
That's fuckin' gay as hell.
Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
There you go. You're back on the track.
(Stop this car right now!)
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
Huh?
The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
Are you being serious?
This is very serious, Butters.
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
What does it want?!
Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
A note?
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
I don't know, I didn't read them!
You didn't read them?
Of course.
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!
"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Oh boy.
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
The Geniuses...
He didn't read it?
We know. It's preposterous.
What the hell are they doing now?!
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
Halleluyer! Somebody call the IHOP, 'cause I made pancakes!
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Nnnaw
Not again.
Butters! Butters, is everything okay?
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
Tell your friends they'd better get it done!
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
And now the scraping off of the pudding.  Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face.  The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation.  And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again-  yehhss, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes.  He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world.
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
Skeletor is real??
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Skeletor's a lady??
Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
Hey Eric.
There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
Butters, what are you doing?
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
Your T.M.I.?
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
Butters, put your clothes on.
Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
What's going on?!
Wuuuuhhhhhh! 
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
Every single night.
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.

I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late

Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
Slash is make-believe??
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
Well what the heck do we do now?
I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
Vunter Slash kapunshka. Shpielerin manshunshka. Het mine gaset rosa-

Butters! Butters!!  BUTTERRRRS!
Oh hey Dad.
You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you son!
I love you too, Dad.
Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
Sure.
What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
Sure.
I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
Inspector Butters, what do you want?
Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
What? Why would I do that?
Who am I speaking to now?
Me, Butters.
Ah, Butters. You're back.
Sir, I'm confused.
I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
Really?
Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
Pardon me?
What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
Yes!
This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.
Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
Yes. did you catch something?
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!
Huh?
What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Get in there! Move it, asshole!
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it!  Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are!   Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!
I'm trying, sir! 
Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!
What?
Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
Okay, see you tomorrow.  And on that Asian Diversity day you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japanese dog. 
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help!  Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem!  The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!
Um, excuse me?
No no nonono! Don't call out for help!  He's got a gun.
Wahh!
If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
What??
You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
Dr. Janus sure has a big house, dudn't he? He's planning on hurting people; I just know it!
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
Yeah!  Butteers, what are you doing in my house?
Hah?
Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now.
Aw man.
Come on, let's get you home.  Where are ya gon', Butters?
Oh, come on!
You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!
AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA!
Butters, come on! Try and come back to us!  You can't run forever!  Excuse me, did someone order a pizza?  Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back!  You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!
Waaaa! 
That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. 
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. 
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
That's right, it's a butt fungus.
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
Nice!
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
Adam Sandler's funny.
Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. 
Yeehaw! 
Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?
At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
Oh my God, are you alright?
Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.
I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
Wugh, game on. 
Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work
It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente.
Wow! A present just for me? 
Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you.
Ah, sí señor.
Work, Mexican, work.
All week long, bossman say
Work, Mexican, work.
Sing your Song, earn your pay
Sweat
Meheecan
Toil
Meheecan, it's your
lot in life.
While people play in the sun all day
Come on, honey. 
Hey, where are you going?
No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!
Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! 
So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
Sí. Es famoso! 
Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
No... no. ¿Saben qué? Mantequilla tiene derecho. ¿Por qué venimos a este país? ¡Vale madre aquí, 'mano! 
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
Debemos escuchar a este niño. ¡Mexico es mucho mejor que esto! 
All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
Sí, ¡vamonos a la chingada!
Viva la Meheeco!
¡Este lugar es una mierda! ¡Nos regresamos a Mexico!
We're crossin' the border!
¡Jose! ¡Martinez! Nos vamos para atras para Mexico! 
Olé!
¡Vamos Mantequilla!  ¡Vamos Mantequilla!  ¡Vamos Mantequilla! 
Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  ¡Oy!  ¡Oy!  ¡Orgullo!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. 
Wow.
¡Hoy celebramos el primer día de Mantequilla, honrando el espiritu de México! 
Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
Mantequilla, tu tienes que hacer una decisión. Los Estados Unidos están de baja, y claro, México pronto será el mejor lugar. Pero como Mexicanos, nosotros sabemos que nada es más importante que la famlia, y amistades. Estás invitado a vivir con nosotros, Mantequilla, pero tienes que seguir tu corazón. ¿Quieres quedarte aquí con nosotros, o quieres estar con tus amigos? 
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
Wait a minute, isn't that...
Game on!
Oh no you don't! 
AAAH!
That asshole is not getting across my border! 
AAAAH!  I'll get over! 
No you won't Butters!
Giddy up! 
Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
Base! 
El mirito, vinto! 
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!
I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
Eavesdropper?
Dude, that's so wrong!
Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
It's megasuperhilarious! 
Ew!
Sick!
I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and-  HEY! 
NO Wikileaks! Bad!
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
Biggest story about who?
Excuse me.
There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks! 
Can't this thing go any faster?
Hang on, Lemmiwinks!
Oh dude, he is fucking him up!
Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! 
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally.
I sure hope this works.
Here we GO! 
Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
Oh neato, huh fellas?
There've been a lot of "stories" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?
Thanksgiving is about murder?
Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.
Okay Dad.
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Eh yeah?
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Heh heh, yeah?
Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
What?
Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
Uh, I won't tell anybody.
I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina.
My grandma is from Virginia. 
You can't sue me.  You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way.  When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington you're supposed to be facing this way.  So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink.
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
Whoops! 
Butters, what the fuck?!
Sorry. My arms hurt.
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
Oh sorry, sorry. 
You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
Sorry! 
Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
Go Cartman! 
We got it. We got it!
Oh, that's a good idea.
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
Well, count me out.
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
Well, I'm scared. 
Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe.  Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed!  That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up.
Oh, that's okay. I think...
Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
HA?!
Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt? 
Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
You mean it's like, like a monster?
Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
AAAAAAHHH! 
If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
Butters.
AAAAAHHH!
Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
No, it's a school night!
Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
You think Jewpacabra is here?
Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
Oh God, I'm scared.
JESUS IS A LIE!
Eric, stop it!
Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
Jesus is a lie?
No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Sh! You hear that?
Oh, hamburgers.
Guys?!
It's all quiet out front, Eric.
Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
Hey, Eric.
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
Wingstreet?!
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
Heh, h-hey fellas. 
Where's your lunch, Butters?
OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
...Yeah. 
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.
So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
My Grandma?
Butters, what happened to your eye?
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy.
Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
Oh some tea would be lovely.  What's up?  Huh? You think you're  tough, huh?
I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
Think you're fuckin' tough, huh?  You don't look fuckin' tough.
Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
No, you're a little faggot!  You got any more money? Huh?
No, you took it all!
Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.
My grandma??
She said to meet her outside behind the school.
Oh hamburgers! 
Hey twerp!  You went and narc'd on me!
HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
I heard somebody brought in an anti-bully counselor! Thought I wouldn't find out, you little narc?!
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Oh look, what's this over here?  Ohoh, it's a narc puck. This is what narcs have to put in their mouths. Awww, it's got piss all over it. 
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters?
Yes...
My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
Dork!
Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters?
Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. 
Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. 
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
HAAAAA! 
No, go ahead, kwy. Let me see ya.  Let me see you kwy. 
We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
Oh uh, nothin'.
Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead.  Right now. Say it.
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows!  What else do you wanna say, Butters?
Please, leave me alone.
Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?
No it doesn't.
Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
Stop it!
Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?
Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!
What? 
Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
What?
Guess!
Just tell us, Butters.
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
Theh theh, there she is. 
Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
How come?
Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
It's not fair! They were so... happy!
It's gonna be okay, Eric.
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
They'll find love somewhere else.
No, they won't!
Yes, they will.
And you! I should never have believed in you!
In...in who, Eric?
Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something.
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
We don't even understand how this game is played.
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
That's true.
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
Yeah.
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
Yeah!
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
Huh?
The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
I love you, Butters!
I love you too, ladies. 
Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! 
Woohoohoohoohoo!
Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.
I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.
Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 
Hey Butters, you got a minute?
Wuh sure, Eric. 
I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
...I don't have a dad.
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
Youuu save it all?
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
Do you feel warm and compassionate?
Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
Cartman, you idiot!
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost.  Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level . With Butters' Creamy Goo.  You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine. 
Like me!
Best served just above room temperature.
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
Ohohh Randy, it's happening! 
Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!
What's sarcasm and what's com?
Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but "So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you." Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.
DAD! Hey Dad!
What?!
My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.
Thanks, Dad.
Butters?
Leave me alone!
Butters, come out here.
Get out of here, all of ya! 
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
...Wow.
Double wow! 
Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!
I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.
It's not?!
It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.
Yeah?
You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
Hey yeah, all the time.
You know that's not allowed!
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.
Uhbu-but I'm from here.
No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.
We're from Hawaii?
Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. 
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
(Butters, come on.)
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
(Me?)
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
(Okay, okay! I'll go.) 
Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
Can I help you with anything?
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
Okay, were you wit a cruise ship or land tour group?
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
Butters Stotch?
Yeah?
Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony.  Ah- uh, who's this?
Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now. 
You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
Oh yea, let us eat.  Aloha, five order of saimin, please.
What's "saimin"?
In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island.  Now drink the chi-chi! 
Whoa, it's like gasoline!
Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away.
Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome!
I've never done this before. 
It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.
Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 
He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!
No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists.
He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed!
Kenny, be careful!
(Whoops!)
Kenny!
Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on.  This child sunk a cruise ship by himself! Tell them keiki. 
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
Screw them!
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
You can and you MUST!
Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government.
Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
We can't hold out here any longer!
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
Young keiki, try to control your anger.
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys.  Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa!  It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?
Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
Yeah, it's true, uh huh.
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
(You do?)
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
Ya think? 
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 
Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 
I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
Uh huh.
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it.  Hey Butters. Stand ground.
Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 
You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
No! This is stupid!
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige.
Who?
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
Go Stan!
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
Yeah!
Prostitute!
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
People are saying that? 
Yeeah. Is it true?
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
Oh my, it's the sound!
Wu-what sound?
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
Butters, you know something, don't you?!
Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
What did Cartman tell you?!
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
Tell us what you know right now!
I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
Is that an M&M?
It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Then you have to tell us!
Well... hah... HWAAAH! 
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. 
All right, but don't take too long. 
What's up fellas?
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
Bleh, ogayedmi.
I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
AGH! No! Please! You can't!
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
At Red Robster. 
Where?
Red Lobster!
He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"
Red Lobster!
Ruh Rehh... Red
Red Lobster!
Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
I didn't say anything. I promise.
I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
The government watches everything we do?
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
Next!
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.
Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
Why not a thousand "Livin' In America"s?
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
Hello sir. My colleague and I are going through the neighborhood and seeing if you'd like to know the Truth. 
Sure, I love the Truth.
Okay, we from uh Jehovah Witness. We Kingdom Hall Jehovah Witness, and uh, we believe, sir, that uh many people interpret the Bible it wrong.
Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
We are, sir. We believe the, the Truth. I was once like you. I knew not what to believe, then I let my pulvy the Jehovah into the heart.
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
Yes, because uh Jehovah will bring judgement against all who perish like the little girl will burn in fire.
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
How long they been watching us?
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
I don't go to DMV. I don't have car.
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
Hey Phillip! Pull my finger!  Aaaahahahaha. 
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
...The truth about what?
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
...Okay. 
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
I have no idea.
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
Yes sir.  See, i used to be like you. I go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts, puttin' nasty picture on my nasty Facebook. But then I realized, all these things, they live forever, because the government keep a file on us. So all that live forever up in what they call the Clou'. It's a government term. If they could put a file in the Clou', then I wanna make sure I come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the Clou'. Because we all live forever in the Clou'.
Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
Yaaaaaay.
Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
Wow, those people over there seem like they're havin' fun. 
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
Okay, hon.
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
What's this?
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
I can be forgiven?
Yes.
For everything bad I've ever done?
Yes!
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
That's right.
Thta's pretty kewl.
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
I do, I love my country!
Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Hallelujah!
My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes!  Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide!  I'm talking of course about  murder porn!
Murder porn?
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
Butters, what happened?
I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
Well what the hell is that?
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble.  Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run.
Huh?
Engine engine #9 running down Chicago Line, if the train should jump the track do you want your money back? 
Yes.
First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?
Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
The government is looking for a Patient Zero, going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport.
Anyone with information regarding Patient Zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately.
Holy Moly.
Yeah, that sucked.
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
Heheh, yeah. 
There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 
Whoa, look at it!
No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
I gotta show this to my mom! 
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
Nothing. 
Busted!
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Just stop, please.
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
Woo, spooky.
Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
The shoppers... Hm... They started showing up at midnight on Thursday... They... didn't line up, they just crammed themselves near the main entrance... I can see their faces smooshed up against the glass, licking their lips, waiting to get in... God, the sounds that they made... It was 5 am when they opened the doors... There was screaming... blood... people... tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background... I saw a woman... pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head... Before I knew it they were all around me... fighting, clawing. Then a hand reached in and pulled me out. Old Cap. He saved us all that day.  When it was over... the front of the mall was... covered in red. Bodies... shopping bags...  And now winter comes again. 
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
What do you mean?
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 
Yeah!
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
They don't!
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
Yeah, I finished it!
So what happens when the dragons show up?
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
Wha-what do you want me to do?
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
Who's George R. R. Martin?
You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made.  Do yo know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve.  Clean that shit up.
Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
Can I help you?
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
Who is this, please?
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.
We're not fans!
Yeah, we don't like it!
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
About what?
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
When?
You really wanna know?
Please. It's urgent.
Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight.
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
Uh what's the matter, Scott?
I told you I have to eat every two hours.
He's diabetic.
Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas.
Oh. Okay, thanks.
AAAH! 
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
Yeah yeah, they're on their way. They're still coming. So Samwell's wiener goes 
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
Jeaaaaah!
Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
Okay, okay, fine fine. What kind of pizzas do you want?
What kind do we want?!
Don't worry! They're coming! Not just two pizzas, there's, there's gonna be five! And they're gonna be huge! You won't believe it!
Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 
Wait, I haven't told you what happens yet!
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
Well why didn't you say so? I can help with that.
Whatoyou mean?
That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.  This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet,  but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way.
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation.
What's that?  Awww! 
Then let this be your last fight, Bill Gates. 
Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 
Yes, it is.
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
The South Park video game, coming to stores soon!
Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
Uh, excuse me. Butters?
Oh. Yes?
Um, well, I was just wondering if...  maybe...  you would like to go to a movie this weekend.
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
Okay, thanks.
See ya, Lisa! 
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
What the fuck is your problem?!
Oh. Hey Wendy.
Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
Am I just an asshole?
Yeah!
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
What?!
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
You're a liar!
...Are you serious?
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
Oh, she said it again!
Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.
Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?
Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
Okay.
Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.
That's Lisa Berger?
Do you see what I'm talking about?
She's pretty!
That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
What? What do you mean?
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
Butters!
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
What?! Well since when?
Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
I do love water balloons. 
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
What's a PewDiePie do?
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
It's true!
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
Heheyehah.
Oh, I like that. 
Rotten boobie turds!
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
Man this sucks!
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
We already got a dollar!
What?! 
One dollar pledge!
I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
Another two dollars!
Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.
It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
Oh no!
Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
Goooood morning, guys!
Happy Deadline Day!
We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
(What?!)
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
What?!
Somebody killed Kickstarter!
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
We finally did it!
Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
Good for you. 
I think someone's in there.
What is that?
That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
Cartman's a girl now?
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
Whoa, wait, is that?
Holy moly! 
Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."  Stan?
Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
...I don't know where I belong...
Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
To the bathroom?
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
Oh! Aah! Mimsy!
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
No it isn't.
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
That's stupid.
You can see the momma bird fly in.
I'm dying of boredom.
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
What did you say?
You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
Whooaa! 
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
You wanna take it out for a spin?
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
No, Eric. I don't wanna d-
Butters, are you home??
Comin' dad! 
Butters, is that you?
Yes, it's me.
Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
Of course not!
Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 
What?! You said nobody would know!
It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
Be careful! The powerlines!
(Okay, try to get closer!)
Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 
(Are you serious?!)
Let me see!
(Stop taping!)
Jeeeeezz!
Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 
What do I do?!
His dad sees you!
I don't know what to do!
Butters?
Oh, heh-hey dad.
Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?
Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.
I love you too, Dad. 
Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. 
What the heck are you doing?!
Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Butters-
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
Butters. Butters.
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
WHY?!
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
Butters.
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Because, Butters-
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
Why?!
Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Oh hey Butters. Sup?
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Dude, what's the matter?
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
Butters.
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
You do?
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
What?
Your dad's drone.
NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
...Okay.
Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
If this doesn't work, we're dead.
Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  "Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."
Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
What?
Congratulations, Kyle.
This is stupid!
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
What are you two boners doing?
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
You guys wanna put some money on it? 
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
Butters, what the hell are you doing?
I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? 
More of the school. 
What are you doing, Butters?
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
What what what?
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
I'm sorry!
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
Yeah.
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
Oh Jesus! 
Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
Suppornity window dropped. 
Welcome back, dude.
Wow! That was cool!
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
I touched Wendy's boobs. 
Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
Yeah. 
Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
Well, not a hundred percent...
Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 
Okay, subject is ready.
Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
Interim status is go.
Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Going now! 
Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
Okay.
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
Just take the money, Butters! 
Okay, I got it!
You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
Already? Oh no!
Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!
Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!
I know that! What do you-?
This is for all the times I got grounded! 
Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
Butters, why?? Oh my God!
Huh, that was incredible!
Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
Hey! 
Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
Wait, hang on Butters!
Take that, you dumb hooker!
What you doin' motherfucker?!
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch.
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine.
Aw nuts!
Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out. 
I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
Butters. 
Ahhh!
Are you okay?
Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
I'm not here, Butters.
What?
This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.
Nuh uh!
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
WHAT?? 
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!
Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
Ah how do you know that?!
Everything okay in here?
Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
Butters.
NO!
I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 
AAAAAAHAHAH! 
What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
Are you fucking with me?!
...What? What do you mean?
Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
I don't know what you mean.
Because if you are, it's not cool!
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
Oh gosh!
That's right!
OH GOSH!
THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
Yeah.
Hello?
Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
Again?
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Uh huh.
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
Butters?! Who is that?!
Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- 
Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
Butters.
Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.
Why not?
Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
So now we are in th real world.
YES.
Butters!
AAaaghagh!
What are your friends doing here?!
Huh I'm sorry Dad!
No. I've I've got to tell him!  Butter? Butters! 
Ahhh, huh?
You can go outside and play, son.
You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.
They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore
Ohhhh!
Oh no! Kenny!
Shhh!
But he's dying! 
Yeah, you gotta know people.
Dangit, I wish I knew people.
Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
Yeah.
It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
Wow, the cops came?
Whattaya think?
Hmmm, it's kind of gay.
Really??
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
Well, gay is wholesome.
Yes. Yes, please!
Me, too!
Pass this up.
Pass this up.
Shut up, Pip.
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Butters, is there any way out of here?
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
What are you? A sourpuss?
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
Hey, look at this!
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
Neato.
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
What do I have to do?
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
Oh, that's a splendid mission!
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
Air shaft.
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
We're going upstairs.
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
We did it! Great job, Angels!
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
I don't care, just hurry! 
Well, hooray!
Okay. 
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
Dude!
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
Mommy's little boopie-kins 
Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them. 
Whoa!
Whoopee! 
Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
Get a hold of yourself, man!
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. 
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! 
Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?
Huh?
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams. 
Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!
There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
Okay, let's get him... 
Got it. 
Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?!  I said, are you ready to rock?!
Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess.
Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! 
Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? 
Hi, guys. 
Woo-oh Holy Cow! 
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
Yeah. He's a badass! 
Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. 
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
No! He's my friend!
Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. 
Well, she sure is.
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
What battlefield?!
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
We'll give you 10 bucks.
Oh. O-oh, okay.
Lin
Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
Ready!
On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! 
Oh, boy! We'll show them!
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
Yeah!
Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-
All right! Let's do this!
Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
Uh-get set. Go! 
We won! We won!
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
Timmiihh!
Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
Timmih-
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
Uh, Butters, could we have it?
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
Ha-a-ugh.
Well, uh, see ya, fellas. 
Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 
What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!
I am the tooth fairy, my child.
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!
Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful , bright, little boy.
Well, uh I sure am, I guess.
That seems kind of... weird.
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
Now, are you a team player or not?!
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
Well uuh-uuh-alright then. 
Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
I don't care! Get down here and do it!
Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 
Go on, Butters!
Ho, I don't wanna!
Butters, go on!
Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
Okay. I'll get our coats. 
Can I go now?
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
Huh, where are we goin'?
Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
Oh well, we're busted. 
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
Wwuhuh-o-kay! 
Geez, what's up Dad's ass?
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
Ah, I can do it again.
We'll let you know, Butters.
Ahah-oo well, alright then. 
Nononono!
Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
No??
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
(What?)
Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
What, Butters?
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
What'd we do to Timmy?
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
He had sins that he didn't confess!
What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
...they've killed Kenny!
He had sins that he didn't confess!
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
Huh-Hallelujah!
Wow!
Jesus!
Yea! 
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
Why, that's PERfect!
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
Huhuh, look at all this stuff.
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
Huh-it sure was.
Oh yeah, time travel.
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
I know.
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
What is it, Butters?
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
How good?
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die?
They've got special effects! 
What Butters? 
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Butters told us their play was awesome! 
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.  Now, we don't have quite enough  manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. 
Hey! Ours is still alive!
Oh dear.
I'll throw in a dollar!
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
Huh-I'm in for five!
Six!
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
Who-what's a hummer??
Hello? Is anybody here? 
Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?
...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
...It's... just you here?
No, uh Craig's here, too.
Oh, good.
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?
Huuuhhhh, no.
How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
Yes.
Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
Yes.
Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
What? 
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 
Parents. Mom. Dad.
Oh boy, here it comes!
Take him down. 
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Yeah.
Hey! Here they come! 
We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on.
Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
God job, Butters.
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
See ya! 
Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"  "Huh, Butters, ma'am."   "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"  "Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." 
Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
Very good, Timmy.
Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
Yeah, he's excited.
Hey, fellas!
Hey, Butters.
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Jimmy's funny, dude.
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
Go away! I'm dead! 
Oh, well, here he is.
Really? wull-why?
We can't tell you.
Why not?
Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
So wait, did we do good?
Uh yeah, ah I think so.
Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.
Me neither. 
What's going on? 
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
Wuh what are you gonna do?
Awesome! Give me mine! 
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
Hoh.
'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
Hoh boy, oh boy! 
...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
AIDS?
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Oh my God, dude.
Uh what are we gonna do, huh?
Why does that matter?
Ha-I'll be nine next week.
Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty.
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
Doesn't it give any other directions?
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
Uh, what are "studzes"
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
Just put it on, Butters.
Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 
Sure.
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
Ah, I got rubber bands. 
Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
How do you feel?
...Pretty good.
Do you feel protected?
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
Here, talk to them, Butters.
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
...Not really.
Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?
Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
Stop breathin'?
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
Well. Alright, then. 
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! 
Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
Let me see! 
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. 
My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
W-what?
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
You made a goofy face!
No! That's just what I look like. See?
...Don't you make that face at me, young man!
I'm not makin' a face, mom!
Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 
Another week?  I hate my stupid face.
Butters! Hey Butters!
Hehyeah?
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
I sure am, Dad!
Alright, you can take the paper bag off.
Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!
Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-
Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-
Put that bag back on!
Yes, sir. 
...Good job, Jew!
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
They sure do.
Pussy. 
Heh yeah, later, puss.
(All right. I'm fine.)
Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!
What, Butters?
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
Tell him we're busy.
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
Alright, let's go see what he wants. 
Oh, it's all sticky. 
Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?
Uh, yeah?
Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
Eh, just about.
Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
Oh. Well, uh okay. 
Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is.
It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud?
Turn a frown into a smile for free?
Who's the kid with a heart full of magic?
Everyone knows it's Butters!
That's me.
Who's the boy with the eyes full of wonder?
Who thinks being yourself is the best thing to be?
Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?
Everyone knows it's Butters!
That's me.
Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the hallway
Pettin' at the petting zoo. He loves John Alway.
Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,
Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!
Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .
I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house.
Yes sir! 
Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?
We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.
Dad's a good shopper all right.
Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? 
Sure I do!
Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?
Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! 
Everyone know it's Butters!
Uh, that's me!
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
"White Swallow Bath House"
Everyone know it's Butters!
Uh, that's me!
Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
Well first, he went to see a movie.
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen 1 through 8.
Oh my God...
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
To the gym.
To the gym?
Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
Gaah!
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?
...Butters!
Uh, that's me!
Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?
Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
I'll be back in a little while. 
Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
...Butters!
That's me!
Locker two thirteen! 
Uh thanks! 
Dad?  Dad, you in here?
Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
Well, that's four fingers; try five.
Uh, Mr. Garrison?
...Who is that?!
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
This room's taken.
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
OOH! BUTTERS!
Hi Dad! 
Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
Everyone knows it's Butters!
That's me!
Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?
Uh, hey Dad.
Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you.
Well, sure thing, Dad.
Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."
Little white lies?
You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.
...Uh, who's Jack?
Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.
Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.
It won't? Oh, good.
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.
A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.
Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
Everyone knows it's Butters!
That's me!
Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! 
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
...Butters!
That's me!
Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang.
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.
Hello?
Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?
Who is this?
Uh, is this the Stotch residence?
Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?
...No.
Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?
...No.
...Butters!
That's me!
Hallo, what can I do for ya?
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park for the weekend. Won't be back until Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride Sunday, if ya like.
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
Well, then, looks like you're walkin'.
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 
'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod.  'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod.
...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
Well, uh good luck then.
Oh jeez. 
Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble! One of us! One of us! 
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...
Why can't he see us?
...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Everyone knows it's Butters!
That's me!
My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! 
Happy Anniversary!
Not now, Butters!
Oh.  Alright, then. I-
Son! I don't believe it! 
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
Oh, my baby's back!
I ain't grounded, am I?
No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?
Lie?
Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 
You sure are.
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
Yeah!
We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
Yeah! 
You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.
Ye-!  wait, what?
And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
We sure are.
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
Really?
Naw, I'm lyin'
Let's go, son.
Wuh comin', Dad! 
Everyone knows it's Butters!
That's me!
He's still lookin' good!
His name is Jared
His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...
Uh, hey, fellas.
Hey Kenny
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
Hey South Park!  You can meet Jared IN PERSON March 6 at the Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square!
Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!
Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. 
Sure, let 'em in.  Hi kids. 
Wow, Jared!
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
Me?!
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
You mean like Jared?
Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
Wow.
It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. 
Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
Then eat your puke.
No!
How do you feel, Butters?
W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!
Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
Well alright then.
Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
Hey fellas.
Yeah, you're still fat!
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
Check.
Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.
That should blah  ah- here. 
Woahhh!
Alrighty.
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
Bohogh, egh. 
Waaaahh!
Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
Everything's getting dark...
It's out of control! 
Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. 
Butters? Butters?!
Mom. Dad.
Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!
Yes sir.
This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
Four times, mom.
Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!
Yes, sir. 
Come on, Butters. Time to go.
Uh- go where?
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 
What?
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
No- but you don't sound like me.
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
There you are, Butters!
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
Hu-oh! Goody!
Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
Uh- perfect.
Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
Butters, it was my pleasure. 
Hi, Mom and Dad!
DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! "(Punch)"
Ow! Dad?
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH NOW?! ANSWER ME!!! 
Aaaa!! 
All right! 
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 
Shh-shh, here he comes.
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
We'll meet you boys on the slopes. 
Hey, do you guys smell that?
Smell what?
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
I don't smell anything. Do you guys? 
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...?  Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time.
So where's the part where we have a good time?
Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. 
Wuh, that's my face, sir.
Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together , in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French fries,  Pizza,  French fries. 
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
Yeah, prob'ly
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
Yeah! Yeeah! Yeah! You lose, Darsh!  Yeah! 
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
I dunno.
Let's dance. 
Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow.
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
Tad's got the lead.
Come on, Stan! 
That's awesome, Kenny. 
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Okay, Not-Kenny.
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
Oh, all right, then. 
Oh YES!! 
Oh, that'd be awesome! 
Awesome!
Cool!
This is gonna be so funny!
Uh, it sure is!
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Yeah.
Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters.
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
We-ell hold on a second, you guys.
Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
Hang on now.
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
Yeah.
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
Kenny woulda done it. 
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
Yeah.
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum.
Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
That looks awesome!
Aw, I feel silly.
Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face.
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?
What circuit?
The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak.
Oh they, they do, huh?
We don't take kindly to that.
Well I can certainly see why.
It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.
Lobster Boy?
So you know what we did to him?
What?
Now Lobster Boy is no more.
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next.
Oh, Jesus, see me through this.
Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado.  Thanks so much for coming on our show.
Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.
So, is it tough being ...different?
Uhhh, yeah.
And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
Uh oh, we're losin' him.
I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
Uh what condition?
You have balls that hang off your chin.
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
What names do they call you at school?
Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" 
And do they call you "freak" and "weirdo"?
Well yeah, I s'psoe
Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
Uh, sure.
Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!
Oh really?
Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
Oh I'm sorry, mom.
Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!
Yes ma'am. 
Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
Oh Jesus! They were??
Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?
I- told them where to find you.
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 
Napoleon Bonaparte?  I think he's up here. 
Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?
We've got big news! The union is striking.
The union? Oh, that's why you came?
We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up.
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
Grounded for what?
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.
Yeah!
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
Boy with Balls on Chin doesn't wanna picket. 
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
Why? You're not a SCAB, are you?
NO I I'm not a scab.
Better prizes!
Better prizes.
Now!
Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together.
But I gotta get back to my family.
Now!
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!
Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.
A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of hours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with "freak" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, "Look for the True Freak label" 
Look for the True Freak label
When you are watching a TV talk show
Remember somewhere,
our union's growing
Our wages going to feed the kids.
And run the house-
We work hard, but who's complaining?
With TFU we're making our way!
So always look for the True Freak label,
Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!
Now we can go on with our careers!
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 
Oh. Double hamburgers.
Get him! Get him! 
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 
Butters!
Oh I know.
Yeah, I wouldn't have.
Huh, me neither.
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
Heeeey! 
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
Huuh what's the matter?
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
Eh yeah I do too!
Butters has that at his house?
Hey fellas!
Butters!  Did you bring it?
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
All right!
"Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."
What?
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
Kiss my ass!
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
We're with you, dude.
Yeah.
We're with you, Stan.
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father.
Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
Butters? Answer me!
But they-ah they're angry at me.
Butters! Right now!
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
WHAT?!
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
Good night, fellas!
Good night.
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
He might be right, dude.
Aw, heck. 
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
Me neither.
Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where three insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle.
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
...I don't believe it.
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 
Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
Ew, they're all dirty.
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
What is that?
Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom.
Okay Cartman!
All right!
We're going! 
You see, in the six days since the word "veal" was officially changed to "little tortured baby cow" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see "little tortured baby cow" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'.
Really?
Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
Hear hear.
I'll say!
Aw, we're still grounded?
Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
Ehyeah!
Kyle. What's your name? 
Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
Get all the stuff! 
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
Oh Jeez. 
Huff, huff
Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! 
Argh!
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
Awww!
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
The TV left.
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! 
Whre do we go? Where do we go?
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
I told you, we can't go to my house!
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...
Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
Oh Jesus! Wait.
What?
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
I'm sure! There's no way!
Well why not?!
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
They have to show it! They promised they would!
Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
Oh, dude, let's go!
Yeah. 
I wonder if it's all a western?
How far away is June?
I'll do it.
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
Butters, could you take a seat, please?
Wuh well, sure. 
Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
Wull what is it?
Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap." 
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
Not working out?
Lame, yes.
Well, but ah I can get better.
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
Yes, well, we weren't.
Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
Butters, time for bed.
Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here. 
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! 
Good morning, Butters.
It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
No,  I didn't hear about that.
Yeh, you didn't? 
Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. 
Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? 
Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.
So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.
Ms. Choksondik,
What is it, Butters?
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children-
Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
Five. 
The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
Who are you?
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
Hey! That kid took my last eraser!  Come back here, kid! 
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.
A note?
Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
Hey Butters.
Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.
Join me?
Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
But why?
I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
General Disarray.
Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
Yeah! All right! 
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
It's on all the way.
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
Suckup.
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one. 
Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
What do we do now?
Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 
This is, General Disarray. My final solution. 
What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
Yeah.
Hey, fellas.
Oh, hey Butters.
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
Arrrr!
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Yeah.
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
Professor Chaos!
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
What dastardly deed are we doing now?
Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
Oh. 
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
Oh, awesome!
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. 
Huh?
They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
So how do we build it?
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
General Disarray, are your parents home?
No.
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
What?
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
Oh, uh...
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger.  Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square.
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.
Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day.
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
Stupid Simpsons...
Gnaaahahahah!  I pulled out my hair!
Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.
Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
Simpsons did it!
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Let's go! 
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
...Simpsons did it.
Dwaah!!
Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama when Bart builds a machine that takes cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace them instead, with mayonnaise.
Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! 
No! No! 
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
Aaaaah!
Don't have a cow, man.
Oh sweet Jesus!
Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 
Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!! 
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!
Haaah! 
Hello there, children!
Aaah! Nooo! 
Hey Butters.
Haaa!
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Cartman?
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your priest? 
Compassionate.
...Like ...money? What?
You mean, like a goldfish?
I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? 
Really?  I've never done that before.
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
Awesome!
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
Woohoo.
Uh here comes an SUV. 
Hey, that's what I wrote about!
Me too!
Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! 
Stupider than Bebe!
Yeah!
Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Sure is!
Uhyep.
Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Then we gotta work on your campaign.
Look at those ridiculous things!
Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!
Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?
Huh, I'm over here, Dad.
Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.
Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!
That's our man. Here you go. 
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
Spank that ass. 
Whoa.  Neat-o.  Well, this is good.
...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...
Oh golly.  Hey, what's happening down there? 
We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
Wha-wha, what are you doing?! 
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
Bwaagghh! 
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
Let me have the tape!
No, we have to return it! 
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
Butters?  Butters!
The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
Butters, where is the movie you were watching?
They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
Precious.  Let me see my precious.  Plee-ee-ee-ease! 
Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
The Butters knowses.
Oh brother!
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
Where?!
First, just let Butters sseee the precious.
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
Finally.  It's over.
Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! 
Butters! No!
Now wees hases it! 
It has to go back!
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
Let go of the tape, Butters!
I'll never let go! 
Fine! 
Precious! 
Wait a minute. Where's Butters?
Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.
Where is Mr. Hat, sir?
That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?
W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?
It evaporates.
Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
Sure. 
AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!
Lemmiwinks? NO!
Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
But they killed Lemmiwinks!
Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!
Yes sir.
Butters!
No more... arts and crafts...
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
Dude, how long has your future self been around?
Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
Nobody asked.
Where is he now?
Probably watching Becker.
My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific. 
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
Liver medicine?
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 
Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
I don't follow.
Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
Oh! Are we out for an adventure? 
Here it is. Motivation Corp. 
I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
Yeah, I can't believe it!
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
Who's that?
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
What?
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
Now you know my terrible secret!
...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
Hey look, somebody lost their pet.
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
Fine, then you can come with me. 
Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
Yeah!
Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. 
Poop- poop swatches?
Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?
Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
Well that sounds good.
Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
Hooray!
And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
Wow! Neato!
God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
Boy, it sure is stinky in here!
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas! 
Butters!
Oh, Stan!
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
Butters, we're running away!
We are?
Oh my God, our house!
Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!
Oh, not really sir, I just uh...
Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for JIMMY!  Thank you! Wow. What a terrific audience.  I know what most of you are thinking. "Hey, uh-that guy stole my show..."  Wow, what a great audience. And how about this Michael Jackson guy, huh? I mean, come on...  Wow, what a great audience.  Uh... l... lights, please? 
Hey Jimmy.
Butters, w-where is everybody?
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
So then, how come you came?
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.
I love our class!
Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
Ha-ey fellas. 
Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. 
Hey fellas!
Butters?
Yep. I'm in jail.
You con-fessed?
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
His parents are on their way down now.
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! 
Hi, Dad.
Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!
Yeah.
Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!
Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!
Mmuh well, not really, no.
Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
Butters, will you pay attention, please?
Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!
Jennifer Lopez?
Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!
Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
Ah, I was at home.
(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
How do I do that?
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Stop playing games!
I'm not playing. I really don't know!
Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
No!
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
My weiner??
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
Well pull harder!
...ow... Ow... It's not workin'
Try doin' it faster
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
NOOooo!
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
Okay!!
Let's go! 
...ow... Ow!
Okay. 
Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
Butters?
Yes?
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.
Well, keep tryin', Butters.
Okay.  Ow. Ooww!
Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
You did?
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
Ohhh, never mind. 
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
That's right!
Yeah, ahh, that's right!
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
Dog parade?
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
Oh... 
All right. Let's work it!  What the...?
Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies.
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
Oh, hi Eric.
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
...Ohhh!
Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
Wow!
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
Awww.
Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
Well done!
Almost there, you guys.
Ow...
Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
Wow, neato! An album cover! 
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
Cheese!
No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
Cheese!
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
Oh...
I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
Heeheeheeyeah.
I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
Uhm, oh. 
OH, FUCK JESUS!! 
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. 
Fuck you, Eric. 
Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 
Wow, that's gonna be so fun!
Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
What's this all about, Eric?
Butters, can you keep a secret?
Well, sure I can!
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
Nnn-how terrible?
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
What?? 
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
I just see stars. 
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
When do you think uh it'll get here?
I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
What??
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
AAAAHH! 
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
Oh God! Oh Jesus! 
All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
Are you sure?
I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
Oh God, oh God!
All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??
Butters!
Hwaaaah!!
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
What about my parents. Did you see them?
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
Oh my God, let me see!
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
UUuuugh!! 
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
Who's coming this way?
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
Oh God! I hate cannibals!
They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
Noooo!
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
But I can't see nothin'.
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
Are we out in the destruction?
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
Aw man.
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
Huh... Oh, it's terrible.
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
Whoa!
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
Whaaat??
It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
AAAAHH!
We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
Waaaaaah!
Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
Ooohhhh!
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
Oh no!
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
Uh w-where??
Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
Aren't you coming?
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. .
You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
Hello? 
HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?
With what?
You're not a cannibal, are you?
No
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
Kid, what are you doin' here?
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.
Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?
Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!
He's a peckerface, that's what he is!
Dude, stop it.
Let him have it, Stan!
Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
Over?  Jesus...
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
Well what do we do now?
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
What's Raisins?
Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
This place is awesome!
Hey guys.
Whoa!
I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
W-we are.
Great. I'll put your order in right now. 
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
When do you wanna see me?
As soon as possible!
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! 
Waa... ahaaah... 
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes.
Lexus! 
Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie.
I waited all night for you to get off work.
Oh, really?  Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury...
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? 
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
Oh wow. Thanks, cutie.
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? 
Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? 
O-kay!
Bye, cutie!
Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.
Hi, welcome to Raisins!
Hi! Is Lexus here?
Hey, cutie.
Darling!
How are we doing today?
Oh God. I missed you so much.
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy Wings?
Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
Hey Lexus.
Hi, sweetie! Who's this?
Wuh it's me, Butters.
Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.  So how are you, honey?
I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
Good, good.
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
'K sugar. Gotta run.
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. 
Uh but I spent it all.
What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
On my girlfriend.
You... have a girlfriend, Butters?
Yeah.
And she's... a... girl, right?
Yup!
Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.
Okay. 
Yeah.
Here we are, Mom and Dad! 
Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
Here you go. Porsche will by right with you. 
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
Cool! 
Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
Huh?
You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.
Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
So that's it? We're broken up now?
I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. 
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
Butters?
Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.
What's the matter with you?
Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
Yeah.  It sure does hurt.
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
Huh? But you just got dumped
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 
I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 
Hi Butters.
Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
Well, o- okay Mom.  Bah! Gah! 
C'mon!
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
I dunno. Craig, is that you?
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
Nuh uh!
Yeah, huh, I got you!
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
It hurts! It hurts! 
Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
Just stay still, Butters.
Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
We might pass him off as our pet.
But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
Wuhuff, woof, woof.
In here! 
bu- but fellas, I gotta- 
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
Jesus Christ.  What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
Woof woof.
Come on. Come on, little fella. 'Atta boy. 
Woof woof. 
Right over here.  Good dog. Come on.  There you go, right in there.  Goooood dog. 
Gaaaah!
Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.  It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. This is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique.  The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars.  So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five?  Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'? 
Haba, haba! Habahoaha! 
Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
Butters, you have some visitors. 
Oh well, hi there everybody. 
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 
...No.
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
A tragedy?
Waaaaah!
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!
Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.
Two years ago. Two years ago!
I've got something in my front pocket for youWhy don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it isThen grab onto it, it's just for youGive a little squeeze and say, "How do you do?"
There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket,
There's something in my front pocket-
Whoops. 
Paul. Paul! 
Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. 
What do you want?
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
What?
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
Aaaah!
But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
Get out of my room, Stan.
They're too scared! Looks like they already got served! 
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance. 
Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!
All right, Butters! 
No! No! Noooooo!
Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
Whoa...
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
You... you're my robot?
Yes. I will be your new best friend.
Oh wow!
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
Really?
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Oh, really?
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
Heh. Wow, that sucks.
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
What?
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
You saw that?
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
Nuh uh.
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
No way.
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
How come?
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
Oh, son of a bitch!
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. 
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
Oh. Yeah.
I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
What?
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
...No way.
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
Weak! 
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
Lame!
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
Where is it? Where is it?!
AWESOM-O?!
Wah!
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
AWESOM-O understands.
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
I would like some Sunny Delight too.
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? 
Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
Weak.
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
Suck my balls, Kyle. 
He's made in Japan!
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
What?
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
Hey Nellie, guess what I found scrampin' around the airport. 
Hi Aunt Nellie! 
There's my little nephew! How was your flight? 
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
Didn't ya bring any bags?
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
Butters' new friend is a little strange. He, he really takes playing Robot seriously. 
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing, or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
Right...
AWESOM-O?
Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
Argh! 
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
What's he do?
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
Punch-Drunk Billionaire!
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
Haaaa! Haaaa!
Yoe, you okay AWESOM-O?
AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
Let me show you what I mean. 
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Lame!
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
Not cool! Totally lame! 
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
Let's go! Move, move!
AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Damn you all to hell!
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 
AWESOM-O! 
I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 
Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all-  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?
Hey, robots don't fart!
A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't make any sense.
Hang on a second, here! 
Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! 
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
Huh?
Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
Yeah! ...What's this for? 
Awwwww!
Ohhh, we lost?
All right turd sandwich!
Yeah!
Game on, Jew-boy!
Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! 
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
Ha! You lose, fatass!
Uh hey, wait a minute! 
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
What the hell are we gonna do??
Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
It's true.
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
All right, fine. 
Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
Oh, all right then. 
Butters, you saw! Tell them what happened!
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
I gots some business to take care of. 
Hah! 
Butters? 
Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.
Butters, what is wrong with you??
Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.
You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
Uh... outside? No way! 
Why not?
N-no reason! 
Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Butters, play!  Start playing right now, young man! 
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
Five years. It's been five long, miserable years.
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
Four seconds!
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
Three seconds!
Ohhh hamburgers! 
...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
Will do.
All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 
Boy, that was a great episode!
...You're gay!
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
Well, what are we waitin' for?!
Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
Nice, Butters, write that down!
Lie about celebrities.
Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.
Oh, boy!
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
Sexy Action School News Team, ho! 
All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He's like... an idea machine.
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
Stupid news hair! 
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." 
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
Oh, Jesus Christ
Woo. We aren't havin' a party.
All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
Stan, are you getting good ideas?
Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.
Me too. 
Hey! Let's run naked through the street! 
Ah!
Huh?
Butters, get away from me!
Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!
And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.
Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo...  Wait! Wait, stop the car!  Stop the car, you fucking moron!  Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want that!
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
It's adorable! 
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
Look at his wittle puff ball!  I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you, and call you Mr. Biggles! 
My name's Butters.
All right, all right, come on- come on, young man
Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.
Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!
Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!
I'm sorry.
Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.
Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars.  It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front.
Oh hamburgers!
Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!
Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
A what?! For God's sake, where?!
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?
Well, no, not quite.
Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.
Ah, shucks! 
Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet before anything happens. 
Before what happens? 
We're being stupid spoiled whores. 
H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
HAAAAH! 
So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!
I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
Wuh be careful, Kyle.
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
All right, fine! Forget it! 
Well but, but what happened?
That's not at all what happens.
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 
Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!
What?
Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! 
Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.
Ah I will, Mom.
Aw God, I'm so borrred. 
I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. 
I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
Well yeah, but... we usually win.
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
We wanna play video games.
Oh no!
Ball four!
Aw hamburgers. 
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
Son of a biscuit!
Ah I don't know, just ignore him.
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
Hey Eric! 
...What did you say?
Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"
Butters...  Butters! You can see me??
Well, sure I can see you.
Oh my God, and you can hear me??
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
You died?? How??
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
Butters, what on earth are you doing??
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
Who's seeing dead people?
Me! I saw a ghost!
Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.
Ruh, really?
Yeess.
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.
Huh s-s-super-AIDS?
That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.
AAAH!  Oh Jesus.
So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
Butters...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
Butters, you have to help me!
Go away! You aren't real!
All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
Butters, what is going on?!
Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!
Y yes, yes sir. 
Butters.
AH- 
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
But I don't want to see you!
Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
What do you mean?
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
Oh.
Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.
This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! 
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
Yes?  Oh hi.
This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
Tell her, tell her that I love her.
He says, he love you. 
Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
I can't! Don't you understand?!
He can't! Don't you understand?!
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 
Uhh alright then. 
Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
Aww, that's okay, Eric.
Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
So I won't see you again?
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
Wow.
G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 
Yeh you're still here.
Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
What else do I have to do?!
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
Atone?
Did you ever do anything really bad?
Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
Broke fence...
I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
Really?
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
Does this mean... you have to go now?
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?
Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! 
Butters! What have you done?!
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
All right, Butters, just try to relax.  Doin' just fine, Butters.  Just stay perfectly still now, Butters.
Lu lu lu, lu lu lu 
Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear.
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
Now do you believe us, Butters?
Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
Goodnight, baby. 
Ahhh. 
Butters.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
She's gonna close soon! Come on! 
Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event.
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time.
Really?
Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
Don't worry. I have a plan. 
Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.
I'm so confused! 
Hurry. Go, go! 
Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
Boy, we sure did.
My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too, ghost pal.
You sonofabitch Butters!
Huh?
You told me I was a ghost!
Huh but I thought you were one!
Butters?!
Oh hamburgers.
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. 
Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh! 
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
Butters!
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me.
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?
Well sure I do.
Really??
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?
That's right, Jimmy.
There's our boy. 
Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
Hngh, totally.
Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
What?
How do you know?
Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
Okay. I'm not lookin'. 
Oh my God, Butters!
Oh uh, hi Mom.
Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine. 
Oh... Thank you. 
Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine?
Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves.
Oh...
Where do you buy your clothes?
Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.
All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.
I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it. 
How about we read each other's future?
I will. 
Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! 
Marjorine, what is your problem?
Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
Marjorine.
Nobody likes meee...
Marjorine? Marjorine? Hey, we didn't mean it.
You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.
You think I'm ugly-ehehee...
You're not ugly, Marjorine.
You said I'm ugly and flat.
Yeah. Let's go!
You mean it?
Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone.
My mom?  Hello?
Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
Well, I'm workin' on it.
Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
Hey Marjorine, you wanna know your future?
Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?
Sure.  Here, you do my future.
How?
There's a boy here?
Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
Come on, Butters.
No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 
Hello?
Keep the door locked.
Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me.
Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- 
Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!
Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. 
Hi Dad.
He was supposed to stay dead!
Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?
Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination.
Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
Oh my, it's pretty dark down here. You sure you need curtains?  Oh my God!
Uh hello, I'm Butters.
Little boy, what are you doing here? 
Huh?
Come on. Don't watch it eat. 
Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?
I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." 
Ho! Daywalkers!
Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go.  All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess.
That was a very informative speech, Kyle.
Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
Well okay! Let's do it!
Okay ma, thanks! 
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
Oh hamburgers! What is that?? 
Aw crap.
Oh, now we're gonna get it.
Sн, fly.
Look! The Mexican border!
Sн, bye. 
Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
