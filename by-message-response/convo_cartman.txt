I hope you're making the right choice.
I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 
Draw two card, fatass.
Reverse to you, Jew. 
Yeah!
All right! 
Right. Uh, see ya.
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me.
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?
Excuse me?
I specializes in your asshole, Kyle. 
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
(Yeah! I think...)
Yeah!
All right, come on guys!
Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 
What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!
...Huh?
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
Oh, son of a bitch!
You say he's never been like this before?
No, Chef has always been super-cool.
He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
So what can we do??
Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???
Come on, bitch! Dance!
Up yours, fatty.
Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
Children! What have I done?
It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!
He's safe.  He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.
Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
Get out of here!
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
Here! 
Run Chef!
NO! 
A mountain lion! 
CHEF! 
A grizzly bear!
Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester. 
Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
POOOT! 
Oh never mind.
At Cartman's house.
Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 
Hey Eric, where's Kyle?
Who? 
Kyle, the person leaving.
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
What?!
You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
Come on, people. Come on, people now. 
Dude, what are you doing?
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
THAT's gay, heh.
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
Yeah. You're right. 
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.
Who?
I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.
The smug?
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.
Butters, are you there?!
I'm here, Eric.
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
Turning right at O two four niner. 
Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us.
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
Being smug is a good thing. 
Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!
I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.
We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
Yeah, I guess so.
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 
Ah, that's better. 
Okay you guys, check it out. 
You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.
Yich. 
Hehaha, heh.
Yich.
That's it? That's all they did?
Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
What? What's the big deal?
What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
Uhhh...
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 
Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
Let's all look at why Muslims are upset:  First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what?  Sex. Good.  There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world.  Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody?  Jack off.  Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion.  And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in?  Good, sand.  Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!
What?
Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?
Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
(Like what?)
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
To Los Angeles?
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 
Nooooo! 
Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
You know we might not even make it into the studio.
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
So what made you change your mind?
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
Yeah! 
Are you set?
I'm set! Let's do this!
All right, let's roll! 
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
What are you talking about?!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
What?  CARTMAN! 
Kyle, stop it!
No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 
Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
Suck mah balls, Kyle! 
Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.
This... explains everything.
...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged...
Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!
If we all bury our heads in sand,  we can avoid being any part of this.
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
You just want Family Guy off the air...
Kyle, stop it!
I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
What is it regarding?
It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.  That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. 
Dude, can I go before you?
How come your head ain't in the sand? 
So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
I hate Family Guy.
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
Not nicely.
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
Cool, man.
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
Isn't that like, terrorism?
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
I could do that.
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
I'm a pretty bad kid.
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
I stole the head off a statue once.
Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
You got it, man. You got it. 
Seeya.
All right, let's get this over with. 
Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
Oh, poor kid.
You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.
Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.
Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
What was that?
I I said "thank you." Thank you for listening. 
Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.
It won't take long, sir.  Ow...
All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff.
Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.
Wha?  What are they?
They're manatees.  Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea.
Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.
Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you.  Keith?  All right all right, put it back in!  Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.
Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
That isn't gonna work on them.
Why not?
Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
Son of a bitch.
Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
Well well well! 
Cartman!
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
You fat sun of a bitch!
You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
Shut up!  You shut your fucking face, man!  Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode?
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
I gotta hurry! 
I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!
How the hell did you get out?
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!
You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
I can't let you do that!
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
Ow. Quit it!
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! 
Ow. Quit it!
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
No more timeouts, fatass!
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
What manatees??!! 
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
Shut up, Kyle!
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
No gay speeches, Kyle!
Yes! 
No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 
Thank you, class. Excelsior! 
Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.
Pass it to me, Cartman?
Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 
We know. 
Dude, what are you doing?
He's half man and half bearpig
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! 
Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.
Ah I don't think so, dude. 
I can get you all excused from school. 
You... have that kind of power?
We're trapped in here!
Somebody get us some help down hyah!
Hello, help!
Hello??
(What are we gonna do??)
You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
Me??
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 
Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??
No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.
Cartman, you okay??  You need help??
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 
Maybe we should go for it.
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
Why?
I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
C-Cartman?
Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
Dude, what are you doing?
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
Dude, get away from me!
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 
Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends.
All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 
Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.
Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 
Cartman?
You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 
I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
Yes you do! 
What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
Grab my hand.
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
I can't kick!
Yes you can!
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
I need your help!
No, you just have to save me. 
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 
Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?
It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room.
That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?
Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.
Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!
Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial. 
Eh! 
Eric, why would you do such a thing?
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
You know that's not the point!
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
That's very naughty, Eric.
Well he called me chubby!
I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.
Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.
Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
It's time to call Nanny 911.  We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis.  Parents of America, help is on the way!  Tonight...
Mom, I need another energy drink! 
This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! 
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.
Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. 
And you must be Eric.
Mom, I want a Twinkie.
Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.
Ha! Hahahahahaha
I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
No thanks, I'd rather naught.
Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. 
The hell do you think you're doing?
Come on.  This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed.  Eric, no! This is not acceptable! 
Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
All right, that's it!  You're going to time-out! 
Time out?
Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.
And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
Whoa, how did I do that? 
Eric, you have to stay in time-out!
Ummm, no?
Come on, you don't have a choice.
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
Eric, you need to listen to me.  This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level.  Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?
Because you took my Xbox.
Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
Well, yeah.
And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
Yeah. I guess so.
See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
Oh, I just never had kids.
Why not?
It... just... didn't happen.
You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
What kind of  monster would-
Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 
So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.
Not interested I'm me?
See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.
Yeah, well I don't see why-
Tsst.
Hey!
Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
Mom, this guy doesn't-
Tsst.
Ah! Quit it!
Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
Tsst.
KNOCK IT OFF!
I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
I'm not fat!
Go on, take your son for a walk.
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
Mom, this is degrading!
Tsst.
Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 
Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 
Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.
Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 
Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
Tsst. 
Mom!
It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
God dammit stop ignoring me!
Ahall right.
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
Tsst.
Quit it, mom!
Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
Ooo, Colonel?
I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 
Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
Tsst.
Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
See?
Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!
Tsst.
You can't do that to me, I-
Tsst. 
Goddamnit, you just can't-
Tsst. 
Seriously! Ey? Eh... 
Wow, I have a lot to learn.
Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!
Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 
Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
You can't stay here.
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
You'er not staying at my house either.
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
(Fuck you.)
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
Who is your best friend?
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
What's my last name?
Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
...But I hate you.
...Should that really matter at a time like this?
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
All right, I'm back.
Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.
Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
How is the painting going?
Aw, Goddammit!
Yup, just like you said he would.
What is he still doing here?!
Well let's feed it.
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 
Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 
Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.
I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
Tsst.
Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
Tsst. 
Seriously! Mom-
Tsst.
Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
Tsst. 
Mom?!
Tsst.
Mom? Mom...
Sounds divine!
Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
Kill your mom?
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
Dude, have you lost more weight?
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
Dude, we're not killing your mom.
Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
I'm not shooting anybody.
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
NO, Cartman!
Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!
You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. 
Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.
No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
No, she's just... out to make you suffer!
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
The world doesn't revolve around me?
Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. 
The world doesn't revolve around me!
Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.
Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.
And you're studying before school?
Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.
Tha... thank you?
I love you, sweetie.
'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 
No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. 
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 
Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
We're over here, by the cart. 
Okay, I'm back.
Dude! We've been waiting forever!
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
(I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)
Heheh, totally, heheh.
See where I am? It's this way. 
Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
Get out of here, asshole!
You bastard! 
Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 
Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
He's a God damned butthole!
What?? Why?? Why?!
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
Mine too!
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
I've got better things to do.
Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
I'm just gonna stop playing.
When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
No.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
So what's the p-plan?
All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
I don't play World of Warcraft.
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
Got it.
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
Timmy!
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-
Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.
Then let's move out! 
Look! There he is!
Everyone hold! 
He's targeting us.
Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 
Ike, look out! 
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!
That's it, screw this game!
Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 
No! Nooooooooo!
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
Boars?
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.  We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.
All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
(Me too.)
Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
15 agility.
Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?
Yes hon?
More Hot Pockets!
That's übercool.
All right, everyone ready?
Ready.
Let's go get him! 
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
What's the autolocate macro?
Command-0. 
Okay, right behind Stan.
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.
Christ...
Cast on him again.
Everyone target scorpions.
Nn-Oh my God! 
Kyle! Fire spell!
Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! 
Wait, we need Ben-Gay. 
Hurry dude!
I'm going as fast as I can!
Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!
What hon?
Bathroom! Bathroom! 
Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? 
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
Dude, I'm almost dead.
Kyle, cast arcane missile!
Okay. 
Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 
Dad, no!  You killed my father. 
His shield and armor spells are down!
Attack! 
Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! 
They killed him! We can come out!
Yes!
We did it!
Yeah!
Yeah yeah.
All right, yay.
(Woohoo! Oh man!)
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
Oh yeah.
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
Not yet.
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
Will you shut up about 9/11!
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 
Hey, fellas!
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
Aha! Do you see?
From Eric.
I rest my case.
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
That's right, Butters.
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
What? People see the truth?
Can I go now?
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
Oh no...
It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?
Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
All right, Eric, you can go next.
For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
Oh Christ...
We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
Whoa...
So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
Me??!
Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
Eric, I have to take you to the principal's office.
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.
Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
I'm just doin' my job.
I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
Aw Goddamnit!
Come on in, Eric. 
I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 
The hall monit- me?
If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
Auth- authoritah?
Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.
Ahem. Me?
Hey, kid, get outta there.
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
What?
You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
It's right here. 
All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 
What? You can't just push me up against the-
Argh!
Aah!
I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!
And so this shape with four sides is what, class?
Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
What are you doing?!
I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 
I don't think that's really necessary.
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
Hands?! Let me see those hands!
Haaaah!
Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
It's, it's... I just had it! 
I knew it! 
Huh?
Here, you need a smoke, brah?
Uhh, okay. 
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
I do. 
Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
(Reaaly??)
Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
"stick it inside her and pee"
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
Dude, I really don't see a problem.
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
They what??
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
Well they're doing it!
Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. 
Hall infraction! 
Oh uhh, we were just heading back in.
You got a hall pass, brah?!
I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
Look, just let us get back in-
Get down on the floor!
We're going back inside!
You like bear mace, icehead?!
Bear mace??
You're goin' with Christ! 
Oooooh!
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?
Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
This is unbelievable.
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
Oh God...
You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
Oh no!
What?
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
How do you know that?
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
Who's Beth?
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
Can we get going now, please?!
Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 
But what about me? I want to talk. 
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
She ran away; now she got to deal with the Dawg, huh?
Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 
Hey! You can't leave your car there!
It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
Can I help you?
You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!
Who are you?
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
I think you should leave before I call the police!
Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
Yes?
I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
Do you mind keepin' it down?
Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
Hey!  Uh I got 'em, Dawg. 10-4!
Praise Christ! Let's go! 
Ike, run! 
Bear mace that guy! And that guy! 
Don't move! Don't move!
It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
Ike!
Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 
No! Don't do it!
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 
Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
I've done it lots of times.
Prove it!
Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
You're afraid to do it, too.
I am not!
Then do it, if you're not yellow! 
Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... 
Let's go. Yeah, let's go!
Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 
Dude...
Biggie Smalls?
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
How do you know??
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
When does it come out?
Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
It's time for school
No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 
Noo!! Nooo!!
Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
It's still three weeks.
Oh God...  Okay, how long now?
Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this:  In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its  mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this.  retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you!  So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!
HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 
Eric, you're coming home right now!
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
Oh God!
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
No. There is something I can do.
(What?)
All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.
Do what?
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
No.
It's simple science, Kyle.
You'll die, retard!
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 
I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation!  Oh boy, what'll I wear?!  Hey everybody!
Ey!
Whoa!
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
Eric, get out of there. 
No! No, it's too soon!
Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
Go where?
You're gonna help me freeze myself.
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
Yeah...I guess it is...
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.
All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
Oh jeez! 
Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
Can you... understand me?
Where am I?
My name is Shvek. You are safe.
Safe where, butthole?!
My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
What??
Please be careful. You are frail.
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time.
Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
Young man, you don't seem to understand.  Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years.
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Oh jumping Jesus! 
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 
Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.
What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!
It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.
And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.
Who? 
Science damn you, Unified Atheist League!
Who are they??
No! 
Jesus Christ!
Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  Oh my Science. 
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!
What??
This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child. 
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.
We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 
Something is spooking the ostriches.
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
Hold!  This is it, Time Child.  The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here.
Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 
All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay.
Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. 
SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!
I got it! I got the Wii!
We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.
Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 
TC, wait!
Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!
Here. 
You've done a great thing, TC.  How can we repay you?
Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 
Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your flaot screen.
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.
You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 
TC? What's wrong?
I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you.
Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
My monvert's never looked so clean. 
God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! 
There's nothing to do.
Tell me about it.
Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
What?
Crank Prank Time Phone comes with debilibrator , antimatter fusion cone, andn 30 plain HF watt triggers. Warning: Crank Prank Time Phone is for entertainment purposes only. Makng anything OTHER than crank calls to the past could affect the present and end your existence. Crank Prank Time Phone is not intended for the use by otters.
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
Why does it matter? Bark bark
Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.
I care! Where's the closest toy store??
Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping comples. But it is not open yet.
Come on! Come on!
Store is now... open.  Welcome
Ugh, finally!
Welcome to Zeebod's Toys
I want one of those time-phone things.
Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?
Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
All right, that'll be 6000 credits. 
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
Look, I have to have one of those phones!
Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.
How about a robot? How much for the robot?
Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.
Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
Working, bark bark. Access.
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
That was a great one! 
Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
Oh. Okay, I guess.
Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 
Hey!
Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
Whoa, wait wait! 
Oh God!  Hello? 
Hello?  Are you there?
Who is this?
No, no, I have me.  All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!
What?? Who the hell is this?!
It's me.
Me who?!
Me you!
What?!
I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!
Oh very funny, Kyle!
It's not Kyle, it's you!
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
I'm trying to do you a favor, dumbass!! Just listen to me!
Listen to this!  Dickhead. 
But...  but you're here right now. 
Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
Huh??
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
What??  Who the fuck is this?!
Aw damnit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!
Suck my balls!
No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!
...Okay, you have one minute.
Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?
Are you spying on me?!
No, I am you, you stupid asshole!
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!
What is the Great Question?
Forward missiles launched, sir!
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history.
Who?
Your teacher, the one called Garrison.
Garrison? But he's an asshole.
I'll thell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
An emergency?
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.
Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
Richard, come back, please!  Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!
Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 
All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?
Go... Right... Where am I going? 
Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen.
Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.
So there is no war now in the future.
We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
And what was that purpose again?
We explained that to you already.
Right... 
Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk
I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer. 
Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
There you are, Eric.
Mom! Mom, they did it!
Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.
What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
Who are you talking to, muffin?
I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!
Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
Hello?
Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! 
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.
Ohhhhhhhh?
It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.
Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
That's easy for you to say, Stan.
Yeah, come on! Here we go!
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
Race war! Come on! Race war!
If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not "fighting" anybody. 
Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today?  I would like to share with you all my-
No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. 
Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 
You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.
Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.
Barely! 
No matter how you act, I can rise above it!
"Rise above it!" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking
Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"Hello, fatso!"
Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
Now you know how it feels.  You didn't like it when the tables were turned, did ya?
Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
It's a midget, dude.
Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.
Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win!
Say "Uncle!"
Ung-cle!
Hahaha, now say "Caroline, don't go into the light!"
Caroline, don't go into the light!
Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
Thanks, dude.
This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual".  This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
Is this all you brought us here to see?
Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
Butters is staying over tonight?
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
Hey, fellas! 
Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
Kyyyle!
I mean, that if-
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
What'cha do to Butters this time?
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
Dude!
I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
Because that makes Butters gay now!
No dude, that makes you gay!
Eh- ...what?
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
Nuh uh.
Yeah huh!
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
You are now.
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
How?
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
Really?
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
Butters.
Whoa, hey Eric.
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
A surprise? What is it?
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
Oh boy!
You ready?
Y-yeah!
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
Oh, okay! 
Hang on a second here. 
How come uh, I can't see?
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
Oh uh, ho yeah.
All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
Well okay!
All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
Butters!
Uh! 
Whoa boy! Camp!
Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
What are you talking about, fatass?
I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
You figured that out, huh?
That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
Except for us.
Right, except for you.
And all the people we tell.
Why would you tell anybody?
Because it's really, really funny.
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Like what?
Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 
That isn't funny.
Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
Okay, my turn. 
Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
Where's what?
You know God damned well what!
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
Give it back, Kyle!
I don't have it!
I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
Shut up!
You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
So you say you were robbed. 
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
Okay, what is the picture of?
Why... why does that matter?
Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
All right. It's a picture ...of me.
Yes?
It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
You were sucking somebody's penis. 
No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
...I see.
Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!
Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!
That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
Eric? What's the, what's the matter? 
I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.
Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
Oh, now why would he do that?
Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
What is the picture of, Eric? 
Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
Ohh, that's nice.
But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 
Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
You, you will?
Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.
It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
What?
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
Mom, she's lying!
She said she was sure, Eric.
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
Nono, we're fixing you!
Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.
HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
He isn't actually going to show everyone...
And now this next picture 
Wait. Now I am confused.
And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
Dude.
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
Eric, what the hell is this?!
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  "Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk." She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 
...Lame.
All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
What do you think happens if you do have it?
They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! 
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?
Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
Ohhhhh.
Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
That doesn't matter, it's over.
Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
God did! When he killed my wife! 
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
Me?!
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
Yeah. Right behind you. 
All right, lock that door, Craig! 
What's this about, Cartman? 
I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
This is a scientific test, designed to-
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
It doesn't prove anything!
Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
What the hell?! 
Kenny!
You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.
Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
What? What are you gonna do to him?
He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
You guys, wait. 
What, Clyde?
I... nothing.
All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
You die he- 
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
(Not guilty!)
Guilty! I thought so! 
You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
Wait a-wait a minute, what?
Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
You had head lice?
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
Me too.
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.
Uh oh! 
Thank you.
Duhude, dude,  not cool!
Okay. 
Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!
What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
Yeah?
Kyle, are you on your computer?
What? No, I'm sick. 
Get online. I need you to check something for me.
Dude, leave me alone.
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
What? Why?
Get online now!
All right, all right. 
Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
Over a hundred.
Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
White Stripes
That's funny.
What?
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
Hello?
Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
From what? Who is this?
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
Are you serious?
If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
Like what?
Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
Dude. 
Yeah. 
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
I guess so.
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
Wuh what doesn't follow?
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
Okay.
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
Yeah. Actually, there is.
What?
What?  This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
What do you know?
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
I said I will only talk to the President!
Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-
LALALALALALALALA!
I will have you arrested for-!
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
Hello?
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
Huh? Who.
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
So then maybe you're wrong.
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
Yeah.  What is that?
It's my balls! 
God damn it Cartman!
Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
The call is going through now, sir.
Yeah? 
This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- 
Yes, Mr. Thompson?
Well, we've just arrived in your town.
Why? Did you find something?
Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
A snuke?
That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
Big surprise!
This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying.
Let me have time with him.
What are you going to do?
We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
He should be at school!  Hey!
Where is the detonator?!
Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
I can do this aaall day.
I don't know anything about a-  Aawwwwgh  Stop it! Really!
You can make it stop!
What are you going to do to my wife?!
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
We told you: we don't know.
Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
Where is your son?!
I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! 
Answer it! 
Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
Butters.
Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
We got him! I know where he is!
All right, where? We'll send our people in.
No no, he's my lead. 
You're not going alone.
You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
Uuugh! 
Oh hey Eric.
Where is the detonator!
The what?
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
Hey, I was about to win!
Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 
Get in the van! 
Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
Uhh yes, of course?
America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?
The Russians?
Before that.
The Germans?
Before that.
The Germans again?
Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
You can't possible mean...?
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
Really?
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
...Maybe. 
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
...That is so missing the point.
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
Yes or no, Kyle?!
No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
Awwwww.
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
You know so little! 
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
Ahh, don't you think that's-
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
Smile! 
Bye, Easter bunny! 
You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, "The Old Man and the Sea"!
Have you lost your mind?
(What the hell are we going to do?!)
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
We don't?
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
We looking work, sí.
Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  "The Old Man and the Sea" for us. Comprende? "The Old Mand Y La Mer".
Yeah.
Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
Sí, la samuraisia.
Okay, gracias.
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
Sí.
All right, did you write the four essays?
All right!
Okay, let's have 'em.
Dude, we're totally fucked now!
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 
Crap! 
Hello, class. Here's my little desk , my nice lil chalkboard. 
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
Spare some change?
Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)
No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
Really?
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
All right, here we go! Jimmy? 
Oh! Aww.
Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!
I don't know.
There's a bunch outside my house too.
Spare any change, sir?
No! Fuck off! 
He did?
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
You what?!
Kyle, what were you thinking?
Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- 
You see what you did, Kyle?!
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
They're everywhere!
Over here!  Jump down! Go! 
Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
Jump them?
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
It's dying.
Cool.
Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
Youu heard about that?
Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
Thirty was hard enough.
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
All right, hit it.
Let's hope to Christ this works.

Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip.  That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
Cock! 
The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. 
Dude, that mom is kewl. 
Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!
Are you talkin' to me?!
No. Cocknose!
What's your problem, kid?!
Oh, a-I'm sorry.  My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. 
What?
Asshole ASSHOLE.
Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
Yeah.
All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
Yeah! 
Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 
Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
Puh- pussy!
Oh...
Pussy! Cock! Shit! 
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 
That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
...Cocksucker!
...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.
Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.
But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
He's faking.
Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
Who cares about saying whatever you-?
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
Grrhh, whatever. 
Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
Dicktits!
-when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?
Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 
Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay?  Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
Will you knock it off already?!
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
No! Up yours, fatboy!
Kyle please! I'm sorry!
Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?  Ass! ASS!  We aren't "faking", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass.  PISS! PIIISS!
That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
I'm sorry.
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
I'm sorry.
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
Oh, thank you Eric.
Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 
Well I think we can all put this behind us now.  Piiiss out my aaass!
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.
Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
...Scotch?
Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
Then the game is on, Kyle.
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." 
What did you say?
Uhh nuh-nothing...
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
Hm. That was... weird.
The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no...  Cock!
Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.
And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?
Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
Eewwww!
Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
Uh hey Eric!
Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
Wuh who are you talking about?
Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
Is there a problem, sweetie?
No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen.
Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
Why not?
My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
Why don't you have a seat?
No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
Go ahead and take a seat.
But I'm not gonna do the-
Take a seat, right over there.  What are you doing here?
I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
But you are doing the show.
You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
Why don't you take a seat?
Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
Have a seat.
No, I'm just gonna go- 
Take a seat, right over there.
How does he do that?
Five minutes, kid.
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like "I touched penises with my cousin!"  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
Aw, not again.
Kyle?
Surprise, fatass!
Kyle, what are you doing?
Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
What?
I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
No, I- I beat you!
You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. 
All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
... I don't want the code name Blackie.
Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
This is fucking retarded!
Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
This is faggot. Go ahead.
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
Set off diversion track C! 
Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
Wow.
Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
Dude.
Kyle, suck my balls. 
I thought I did. 
Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
Oh,hello Eric.  Kyle, your friend is here.
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
Doing what?
We had a deal, Kyle!
Just get out of here!
You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
Whatwhatwhat?!
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.
I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.
Yesss!
You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case! 
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
Waaahaa!
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
Hey, he's here. 
What? Move aside, move aside! 
Let's just get this over with!
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
God damnit!
Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 
There's no time! You need to come with us right now! 
Hey, let go of him! 
We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
You goin' to Washington to visit family?
I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom.
Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. "Time to pay up, Kyle."  But then...  "NO! NOOO!"  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
You okay, kid?
NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up.
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
Cartman??
Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
Who the hell are you?!
That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
Get him out of here!
No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
Dude, you did make a deal... 
Theee conference room is which way? 
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
Let's just DO IT! 
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
Everyone to the main hall NOW! 
No! Goddammit no!
Clear!  I'm sorry. He's gone.
No! Kyle can't die. 
I'm sorry, young man.
Kyle?
Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
He's gone, little boy.
Zap him again!  Do it!
Charging.
DO IT!  Come on buddy.
Clear.
Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination. 
Wake up, Kyle. 
Stan?
Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
Cartman, what's happened?
What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
Arh!
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
GAA HAA!
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.
...What?
Stan? Stan?? 
Where are you going?!
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 
We had a DEAL KYLE!
Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
Sector 2? 
What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
What?
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
So it'd be all right.
Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
Missile launch in one minute.
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
Sector 2? 
Kyle?
Abort the sequence. 
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
Awwww 
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
Cartman, don't!
O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
Oh my God.
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
That's true. You did.
Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
Ahhh shit.
Stan, you guys are good! 
I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
But... But this is real.
Real guitars are for old people.
They're gonna do it!
Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
Oh my God this is so awesome.
Go Stan!
All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! 
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Stop cheating, Craig! 
How was that cheating!
'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
What?
Goddammit! God dammit! 
Butters, you wanna play me next? 
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?
No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor
(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
What??
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 
Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
Neato!
At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
O-kay!
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
Ow! What'dja do that for?!  Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! 
Bail, bail! 
They sure don't.
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time." When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
Give that back you dirty buttholes! 
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! 
What?! That's bullcrap! 
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
You're last, dude! 
No way.
Yes way! Check it out! 
Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
Kyle, come back here! 
I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
Hrrgh! 
Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 
Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
Lin
AHHHHHH.
Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.
What?
It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?
No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.
...Ice cream?
What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
Well...you did say free ice cream? 
Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.
Uh. It's over?
That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!
Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
I'm so proud of you, Eric.
All right, so where's my ice cream?
Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.
You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
...What!?
What's that supposed to mean?!
During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
I HAVE AIDS?
Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.
"SORRY"?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE "SORRY"?!
Oh, my poor little baby!
Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
Oh God!  Oh no!
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. 
Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!
NO! NOOOOOOOO!
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
God damn it, this sucks ass!
Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. 
Where the hell is everybody? 
The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
So this is it?
I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. 
Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.
Just bring out Elton John already!
It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!
Jimmy Buffett?!
Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?
Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.
Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
No you don't!
I do. 
If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
Ironic how?
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
Wow, you really know what you're doing.
Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
Kyle? Kyle!
Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
Kyle, what?!
...Oh...
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
What did you do?!
Nothing!
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
AAAAAAA! 
Kyle!
Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
Kind of.
That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry for what, Eric?
I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
I'm going to break everything that you own! 
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
There is no cure, you asshole!
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
What hope?!
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
You're lying!
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
Magic Johnson?
He was a basketball player.
So what?!
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
My God...
Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
I'm so sorry
Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.
No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
Don't. Touch me.
I know. I'm scared too.
You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
Kyle, we need to try to find a-
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
Are you sure?
Yes!!
Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look!  The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood!  Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.
All right!
These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett!
What?! Aw, no!
Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!
What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
Yeah, but we totally don't.
Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. 
Aw dude, that's our town!
A hundred thousand dollars?
That's enough to buy slaves!
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
Sweet!
Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!
We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Cat pee? 
Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
Yeah, this is not gonna work.
Okay, ready Kenny?
(All set.)
All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
Do you feel anything?
Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 
(Okay.) 
Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
(What?)  (Where'd she go?) 
Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
(You fucking asshole!)
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
(What the fuck did you do that for?)
Ah, Kenny! 
(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!) 
Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
Yeah, who has cats these days? 
We've gotta keep this away from him.
Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
Who is it?!
Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.
Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 
You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.
Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
But they will find him.
I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 
What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
(Woooooh! Woooooh!) 
Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
(Me too.)
But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 
Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
Oh God, I'm bored already.
Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up.  Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?
Gayness! 
Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
We don't care. *urp*
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang "La Cucaracha" for Paul McCartney?
No! NOOO!
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
Wait. I've got it.
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
There's more people viewing it!
Take a number and wait with everyone else.
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
And the Star Wars kid.  And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda.  And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. 
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.
Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?!  Ughhh, my brains. 
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
...You are a homo, Butters.
Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 
Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
Any other volunteers, perhaps?
Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
Yes! 
You're not the teacher, fatass.
That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
You're not an awesome teacher!
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
(Yeah, that was my idea.)
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
What the hell is thiiis?
I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
Mah penis!  Stop, penis! Come back here!
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
Yeahhhh.
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you! 
How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!
No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.
Nice form, compadre. 
Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.
Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
Sure thing, Mr. C.
Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 
AAAAH! 
Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
You cheated!
What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
Fuck you, man, you can't do that!
Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it. 
Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
Huh?
Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.
Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me.
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
Good. Again.
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
Again!
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
Now you sound like white people!
Come back here, penis!  There you are! Got you!  Hey, you're not my penis.  Ogh!  There it goes! Stop you!
The answer to #27 is 5.
The answer to #27 is 5.
The answer to #28 is 14.
Man, what's the point?  What's the point of any of this? 
All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.
How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
That cheating is good?
Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
I don't know, Mr. C.
Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.
Uh what?
I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!
How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, "Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat." You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez! 
I reeached these keeeds.
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
Let's be partners, Kenny.
(No, I'm partners with Craig) 
Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 
Naw, I'm with Wendy.
Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
Eric, partner with Butters.
God damn it!
Hold Butters' hand, Eric! 
That isn't necessary!
All right, let's head in. 
You can let go now, Butters.
No.
Butters, come on!
Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.
I wanna shoot an Indian.
Do you see any Indians?
Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  "Super... Phun Thyme."  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Fine, then let go of my hand!
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
I'm not lettin' go!
Fine, then you're comin' with me!
No, Eric! 
Butters, let go God-damn it!
This is not the time for that!
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
Well, that's your problem!
All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
NO! 
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
Sister, you don't know the half of it.
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
What are you whoofelin' at? 
Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
Whoa! 
Yeheah, we're wired up!
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Aw, just a few more things.
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
Yeppir! 
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
What?! They called the cops?!
They must have realized we left. Damn.
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
Shhh! Butters!
We're gonna get it now!
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
You just got me busted forever!
Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
No! 
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
No.
Butters?
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
All right, come on! 
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
That looks dangerous.
Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
Oh gosh in heaven.
It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
Whoa!
Save me!
I'm gonna fall! 
... Oh dude, laaame.
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
Huh... 
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
Let's do it!
Ready? Go! 
Copy that. What's the code, over. 
Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
Yeah, it sure has.
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
Get your hands behind your head!
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
Butters.
No! 
Jesus Christ! 
AAAAH!
AAAAH! 
Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing.  Thousands of Chinese performers playing ancient Chinese drums.  The precision of their movements made even more impressive by their massive numbers. 
No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
Sweetiekins, are you all right?
Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
There you are, Butters!
Uhuh, Eric.
Butters, I need your help.
Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
The Chinese?
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
Why are they gonna kill my parents?
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
I don't want my parents to die.
So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
Well sure.
You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot.  "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.
Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
What?
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
Uh, can I help you?
Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here?  Your waitress will be right with you.
Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
Yeah.
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
Stay calm, Eric.
They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
Herro, prease.
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
Fing fong ting tong.
Ting ton teetong.
I don't know.
Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
HOOOOOOOOO! 
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
Okay, okay.
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
Huh, invasion pran.
What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
These people won't leave us alone.
...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
You aren't Chinese.
Oh my God...
Okay, why don't we go...
Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
A gun?
Hold the gun on them Butters!
I don't want a gun, Eric!
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
Oh jeez...
Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
This is stupid. I'm leaving!
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
Screw you!
Shoot him, Butters!
No!
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
Huh?
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America.
Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.
No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Uhwhat?
One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
All right men, come on. We're going in.
No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 
Ow! Ah, o-ow! 
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
What? What happened? 
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
Aw, I did it again?
What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
Well okay, I'm sorry!
...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
Good! Did you kill him? 
Well it's not where I aimed, honest.
Dude...
I seriously didn't mean it.
Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
By, by my, by myself?
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 
She said it again. 
Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
Eric, stop being offensive.
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
No you aren't!
Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
Not at all.  "Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"
You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!
Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!
You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
You think you're tough?
Whassup?  Whassup?
I'll smack the shit out of you!
Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
You're gonna fight me after school?
That's right!
You're a chick, dude.
As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
Oh, it's on, bitch!
She is pissed off.
She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
What?!
Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
What?
I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
Wendy. Wendy psst.
What?!
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
You really think that's gonna work on me?!
Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
You can't bribe your way out of this!
Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
No you don't.
My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
Eat my underwear?
That's right.
Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
You fucking suck so hard!!
I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
What are you doing?! 
I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
Ew! 
Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
Oh my God!
So...  are we cool?
No!
I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
You are so pathetic!
Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?
What?
You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
Yeah?
Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
Really?
You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone." But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
Detention! That's it! 
Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 
Ahhh, sweet.
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
What?! That's ridiculous!
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
That's not why I did it.
Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
Huh?
You don't understand. He said horrible things.
The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?
The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 
Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
Here she comes! 
What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
You know I can't fight you!
Why not? You chicken? 
I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
Aw man. 
Told you guys.
Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric. 
Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!
Wendy, Wendy.
What? 
Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!
She's coming! She's coming!
Butters, get out of here!
But Wendy's coming to fight you.
...Huh? 
All right, let's DO IT!
What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
I don't care! 
Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
Shut up and fight! 
All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! 
You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
Dude, we never thought you were cool.
That's not true. You're just saying that.
Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
Well yeah.
Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
What?
If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
(Yes they do.)
What girl is gonna see your balls?
Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
I gotta get home for dinner.
Yeah, me too. 
God!
Shut up already!
Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
So?
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
How much?
Two hundred dollars?
Really? Are you sure?
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
...Fine.
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
All right Craig! 
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
Craig, don't be an asshole.
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
And a one, and a two, and a- 
Very cultural, yes.
Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
Ya see, Craig? 
Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
God damn it!
No! No es bueno! 
Jesus Christ!
No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
Go, go! 
Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 
We we speak English!
And we're White.
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
You're being extremely negative, Craig. 
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
There's no talking to this guy.
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
(Yeah!)
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
That's right.
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
Hey, hey, look at this. 
What is it?
It might be a way out, Craig!
Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
I know, a-and look. 
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
Dude, it's Craig!
I have no idea.
Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
Hear that? It sounds like water.
Yeah, it's coming from up there.
Wow. 
Dude, that's awesome.
Craig, dude, wait up.
Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
...Nope.
Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  Craiiig!  No! How did you get here?!
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 
That guy's an asshole!
O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 
Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
That's what bein' friends is about.
(Oh ye-ah)
Everyone is special in their own way, and we'll always be together as one.
What the hell are they doing?
As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way.
Dude, girls are such fags. 
You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-
This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
Okay, good.
Ehhhhhhh. 
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
But you didn't die?
...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...
God this sucks!
Ooohohoo.
You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
Fuck you, Kyle! 
With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.
Oh God, shut up!
Together at school again. What a special day.
Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
Ah, shit.
Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
What? Are you crazy?
No way dude.
What's so bad about hanging out with me?
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!
"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson." 
Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
That's a low blow, Stan.
That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
Do what you want, don't have restraint.
Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in "x = y + 1". Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.
Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
No, I'm on the Japanese side.
Oh, who just shot me? 
M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.
U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
Really? Do you think that's best?
Yeah, now get out of here.
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
Butters?  Butters?! 
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
Dude! 
What's going on?
Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
Oh dear.
Yes.
Lin
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
Yeah, it's just so astounding.
Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
Well, so, w-who is she?
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
Oh, no. Oh, geez!
Butters, what's the problem?
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
W-well, we've heard that she's...
Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
(Huh?)
Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) 
He took it pretty well.
(Thanks.) 
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
(Of course, dude!)
Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
(A purity ring.)
Purity ring?
(Look at this. More DVDs.) 
Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!
What? 
"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
Who the hell are these guys?  Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha.  You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.
The hell did you do to us?!
And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...
I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
Well, now we know.
And knowing is half the battle.
What's in here? 
Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
Who's the Coon?
I know, right?  "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
...Dude, what?!
He's not a fag!
Why do you care?
Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term "fag," Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?
NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you!  Motherfucker!
Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!
Hunh!
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
Aww, what happened, hun?
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
Wha, what?
But who exactly is... Mysterion? 
What?!
Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol.that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.
Fuckin' butthole!
This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.
You gotta be kidding me!
If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.
AAAAAHT!! 
I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!
So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
Not really.
Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! 
Dude, what the hell?
Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!
Yeah, so do I.
What?! Why?
I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
Fucking bitch...
He's all right! 
Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
You want something new every week, fatass.
Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
My fault?
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
Well Eric did. 
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 
I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. 
Did somebody say "catch a Jew"? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
Aww, come on!
Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
Oh God, that show is so dumb.
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 
We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
Let's get to my house!! 
Oh boy!
Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
Dude, I was here first.
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!
What?
Now I'm just going to check for cysts.  Awww! 
What the fuck is this?!
I guess so Katherine.
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!
No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
I threw up on my way home.
Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 
Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Robbed us of our innocence.
Yes, that's good.
Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 
Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
Oh. Hey fellas.
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
My, my picture?
You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator 
Sick! Stop it, lady!
You are woman now, and you are free to queef.
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs! 
Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 
Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 
...So the Pope says, "What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"
Meh. 
Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.
Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? 
What, dude, you got something?
Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
Yeah.
You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
Yeah.
Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.
Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
Yes. 
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
Yes. 
What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?
Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. 
Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
Yes.
What are you?
Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! 
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
We know, Cartman!
Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
P-patent?
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, ""Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?" And my homeboy says "Yeah Carlos" you know, "you're so funny!" And then it just occurred to me. I said, "Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!"  And this is how I came up with it, my amigos! 
Motherfucker!
Really?
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
What?!
Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
Is that... Is that how it happened?
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
I'm... I'm sorry?
It's cool man, it's cool. 
I don't need anyone tellin' me "play on words"! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
You do?
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
That's cool. You wanna write some together? 
That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.
Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?"
Right. And then I say, "Yeah."
So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
What is that?
It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 
And he's not fat at all.
Thanks you guys!
Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it.  But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer.  Hey guys!
Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
It was just a-
Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 
Yes Ma'am. 
Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? 
Uhhh excuse me? 
Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. 
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
Yeah, that was kewl huh?
Eric, there's something I really need to know.
Whassat?
How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
So... here it is.
How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!
What are you up to?
I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 
Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. 
Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.
Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, "Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?" 
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  "Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?" There! 
Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
What?!
You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
What? I, I still don't get anything.
All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
Rih, r-r-really?
I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
What are you talking about, dude?
Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.
Somalia? Where's that?
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
Whoa.
I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
Then why don't you wanna go?
Jews can't be pirates.
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
Good morning, students. These are the morning announcements. Teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next Tuesday.  Please inform your parents. The gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. And now for a special announcement:
Avast there, mateys!  Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life?  Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time?

Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
Fine, I don't wanna be a pirate anyways! 
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
Yeah!
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
And your mom is okay with that?
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
Neato!
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! 
Ho!

Have a good flight. Next, please? 
We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
What?!
Yeah maybe we should think about this.
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
Huh, who, you mean you?
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
No, I'm sick of it!
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.
Oh. He-he says they're in there. 
Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! 
Mayasuk! Hageha-aden! Letka suwahater! 
Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. 
"I don't know what the fuck this is!"
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
"Take them out to the nearest European boat! Show them we have children hostages!" 
Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
"We will get a nice ransom for you!" 
Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 
"Do it now!" 
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
"Move!"
Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. 
Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 
Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 
"We want 5,000 Euros! You easily have that much on board!"
Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
"We are going to start killing them! Starting with the fat one!"
Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
"We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!"
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
"The money first!"  "Go! Get on the boat! Move!"
Alright, let's go! 
"Did they hurt you?"
Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
"What is this?!"
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
Okay! 
I said, get off my boat!
"Hey! You can't order us around!" 
That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs!  Lower 'em down, Ike. 
Have a good day! 
Hard to port, lads!
What's "port"?!
Just make the boat go that way, kind of.  That's good. Now bring her around portside.  Now that's a pirate ship!  A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves?  Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around.  A round of grog for me boys!  A round of grog for everyone!  The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates!  Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy!  Look at this guy for Christ's sake!  I mean, how hard is this, people?!   I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!

My God, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! Gentlemen, I want the President of the United States on the phone. We can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. We have to take them out where they live.
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?
"Another American arrived on the bus!"
Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!
Breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in Somalia. Members of NATO received word today that pirates have captured an American child and are demanding ten million Euros for his safe release. U.S Navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."
I know! I was lying then!
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
Yeah, me too.
Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
Cartman, knock it off!
That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
What?!
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
Clyde!
I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 
You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 
Clear.
The FUCK?!
All the time. 
'Sup, Jew?
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
HA! What a dumbass! 
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
What?
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!
Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want , and still have underwear that sparkles and shines . Order right now!
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
What?! Are you serious?!
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
Because he was a great person, Kyle.
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called "purgatory." It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo.
Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product.
Billy Mays!  It's him!
Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?
Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
Yes!
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
A child... and a female. And white.
Go on by, Michael. 
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
Ignorant.
God I hope this works.
Aww crap!
Hey, what the F?!
(Son of a stinking bitch!)
Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
So what?!
So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
Oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. I would eat it every day, except I-... 
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
How did you know-... Look, it doesn't matter.  I'm just gonna have to give it up.
What if you didn't have to give it up?
Excuse me?
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Woohoo!
Good job Ike! 
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
AWWWWWWWW!
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." Come on, dude, "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." 
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
Alright, your turn Craig.
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
Thank you! 
Atta boy Butters!
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
Wow wee. 
Dude, we've created a monster.
Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?
Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!
Took hid drrr! 
Oh, sweet! 
Yes! Yehhehehes!
This is awesome!
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
The fuck is this?!
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
Let's do this!
All right!
Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?
The Rad Russian.
What?
You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees.
Huh?
Just, down on, down on the floor.  Hands and knees. 
Okay...
Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position.  Here- we- go.
The fuck is this?!
Now just reach around him here. Good.
Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
Ugh.  The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! 
Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
Rrrgh!
The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.
Sounds good.
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
Yup.
Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 
I am gonna k-kick your ass!
You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!
Your girlfriend is a whore!
Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back
I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! 
Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
Irene, no! Why?
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
Irene, you said you loved me!
I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
Backyard wrestling!
Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
Oh! Sure, that works.
You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
What dude? 
We just received a letter from the WWE.
No way!
"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
It's El Pollo Loco! 
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
(Yeah, we've been talking.)
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
Yeah?
Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
What are you talking about?
Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
Right?
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-
Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
Your father! Your own father!  I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!
Thank you. 
Yeah yeah, not bad.
Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.
Yeah, this guy crushes.
He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
Alright, places everyone.
You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
My man can do whatever he wants.
Stay calm, you know what you have to do.
You're just gonna have to deal with that.
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
No, you can't possibly mean that-!
Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
He's alive!
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
(I can keep the baby...)
Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
Dude.
Hey, what about us? Our show? 
Aaaaah.
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
Screw this, this is just stupid. 
Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
FAKE!
Kenny! I'm-
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you weiru , anda fuck you dohfiiin! 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.
Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
What do you mean? This song is sweet.
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
I'm not too busy, Stan.
You're not?
No, I just don't care. At all.
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
But they say you know them. 
Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .
Oh no, no, NO.
What dude?
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
We always have.
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
That's not what we said.
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
We were talking about Wales the country.
(I just want to be on TV.)
Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 
You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!
Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.
Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
(And they're all shot.) 
Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
I, I can't, I can't believe it.
Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.
Will you stop that?
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. 
What dude?
At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all.  Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated.  Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! 
Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!
So that's what this has all been about?
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
Aww! Not those guys again! 
God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
God! Shut up!
Piss off, you stupid assholes! 
All right let's head out. 
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
...What did you say?
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
Yeah! 
No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
Yes.
Agreed.
Okay good, yeah.
Ni-nice, okay.
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
What?
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
Oh that's good.
Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
That was us!
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?
You call them "bike-curious".
...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.  Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis. 
Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
That's it, let's kill them all!
No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
Yeah! We did it, you guys! 
Oh it's over, it's finally over! 
We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
Oh. My. Goodddd.
Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?
M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?
What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! 
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
Oh jeez!
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
Will somebody shut him up?
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
Well, because he was being murdered.
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
All we ask is you keep it shorter.
Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
I pledge allegiance to the flag -
- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
- a socialist dunghole...
Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
Oh God, no! 
Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
NOOO!
I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
Yeah, great job.
"Thank you" and this is to..?
Douglas.
"To Douglas." There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
Hey Eric!
Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
Cool, thanks.
That'll be five dollars.
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
A book signing.
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
I do not directly say she's a slut!
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
You didn't read the rest, dude.
"Or does she?"
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 
You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 
Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman.
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
Whoa... 
The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
"These, are the morning announcements." 
Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
Out of my way! 
Wendy, what are you doing here?!
Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.
Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!
Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits! 
How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!
You can suck my fat tits too! 
Smurfette noooo!
Suck mah fat tits!
And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
Of course. That's why we're here.
Five seconds. 
Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
Sure.
Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
Okay.
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
I don't, I, I have no idea what-
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
Ohhh, he's got her now!
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 
She's speechless!
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
What? What do you mean I know that?
I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
No! You wiped them all out!
Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
I'm confused.
Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.
No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
You sold the movie rights to who?!
James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
Huh!
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 
The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, "Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?" Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.
I'm doin' the best I can! 
Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. 
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
Wha-what are you talking about, Eric?
You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
Come on, let's go!
We got it, Dad.
Six adorable children please.
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
Forget it! Just forget it! 
NO!
What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
Just do it in English!
Most likely.
You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
Dude, where have you been?
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
So what?
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
Well then they're not minorities, are they?
...What do you mean?
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
The black and brown people.
No, you're the minority!
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
The who?
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
Whoopie! 
You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?
Do you need to wash your hands?
Help! Help!
Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! 
Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 
Are you okay?
Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 
Jesus Christ!
It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.
I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
Good.
Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.
You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?
Well, I do just as much work.
You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.
Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
All those opposed?
Noooo...
The minorities win! 
NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 
Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
Hawww, you lived?
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
Open the door, you motherfucker! 
Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
What are you guys doing?
Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!
Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
It serves you right, you cheating turd! 
Oh dude, was that a combo move?
(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
Aw dude, I clocked you!
I told you this game was sweet, dude.
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
Round 2. Fight!! 
Oh, you're going down, Elin!
Pre-nup power-up. 
Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?! 
Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  So I officially announce my return to golf.
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
Yeah, where's all the fighting?
Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
Aww, books? God, I hate those!
Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 
Oh really? Sweet.
...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
Oho man, I can't wait!
Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
No on, come on, let's read it now!
Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! 
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"
Why the hell was this book banned?!
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
We know, we were just saying that.
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
The Tale of... 
The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
It was a... a warm spring morning. 
NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
Butters, what are you up to?
I am?
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
Oh no. Which book was that?
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
That's right.
That's nice. 
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Yeah, I'm broooding.
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
That inconsiderate jerk!
That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
But what would be the point?
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
(It's fucking disgusting!)
All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
What?! 
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 
Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
(Okay.)
Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 
The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, "I need to poop." "Okay," Rebecca replied, "I like poop." Douglas squatted down  over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.  Chapter 2...
See any hunters yet?
(Not yet) 
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
Butters wrote a second book!
So what?
We can get people to believe us now!
Oh dude, sweet! 
Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.
What?!
What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
Oh come on!
Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! 
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
What?
You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
What?! Oh no!
Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
I know, it sucks. 
Alright kids, practice is over for today.
KFC!! 
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
A what?
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
KFC's gone, been replaced.
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
...so no KFC?
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
Mom, drive faster!
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
Alright honey, let's take it easy.
Fuck you!
It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.
No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.
Nooooooooo-! 
Can I help you?
I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-
Really?
-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. 
Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
If you don't want it, that's fine-
NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.
Yeah. Who isn't?
Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.
Billy Miller? Seriously??
Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?
Tommy said you have some KFC.
Suuure.  Jessie. 
Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
I have my sources. That'll be $85.
85 bucks?? I don't have that! 
Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.
How much KFC are we talking?
Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
Holy fuck, dude.
I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
Are you Teabag?
Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money?  Alright, we're in biz.  It's all there, man.
Extra crispy? 
'Course, man, I ain't no fool.
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
Awww, it's all the same shit, man.
IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 
Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... 
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
I'll take back the gravy.
Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
What's going on back there?
Nothin', it's cool.
Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?
Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the Colonel himself.
Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?
I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. 
Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
And how do I know you're not a liar too?
Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.
Good.
What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!
Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
What is that supposed to mean?
I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
You wouldn't do that.
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.
Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.
What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
Hello. Hello??
Colonel, how are you doing?
What happened?
Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
Eric, what happened??
We had a little problem.
I heard.
Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!
Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
Hey, take it easy Colonel.
I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
Luckyyyyy!
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
Stupid Facebok stuff.
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
Surprise! 
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
Who?
Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
No. What's chatroulette?
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
That's just a guy's penis too!
Okay let's, let's try this one.
Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
Hey.
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
Oh yeah? 
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
Yahtzee. 
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
Hello.
Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.
Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!
You should know, fatass.
AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
What did you call me?
Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 
Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take that power from him. 
Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. 
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!
Uh, excuse us for a second... 
What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!
Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!
If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.
You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
Yeah, so what?
You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
More tacos!
No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
More tacos.
You just had seven tacos.
I want more tacos! 
I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?
I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!
You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
Yes they do!
I tried getting one last week!
Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.
God, will somebody shut her up?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
You gonna walk away from 50 mil? 
Let me by...
You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.
Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. 
My father...
Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?
I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. 
How could you know anything about who my family is?
Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.
If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
Eric, what are you doing here?
Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
I said GET. Mr. Hat!
Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
Keep... your hand... UP!
Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.
By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. 
Ahaaa!
AAAH!
Nice work, Conner.
Eric Cartman?
Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.
Them who?!
Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
Then start explaining it to me!
Oh, all right.
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
It's all that matters!
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
Stop talking with your stupid hand!
Who you calling stupid, Jew?
Oh crap, the gingers!
Gingers? No!
Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
You might wanna 
Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 
Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.
Daddy?
Guess again.  Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival.
Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
Oh, but it can.  Revenge is a dish best served...  chili.
Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.  A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father.  Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be?  You've been lied to by everyone!  Even by your own mother!  Hahahahahahahaha. 
What do you know?!
Please, leave my boy alone!
Mom?
Please don't. We have to protect 'em.
Protect who??
They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
My dad was a Denver Bronco?
Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?
No- nooo.
You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
No! Noooo!
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
My dad was a ginger!
Wwait, what?
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
Hey Eric, Eric!
What?
Come on, cheer up.
Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.
Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.
Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
Take it easy, Conner. 
Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?
Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
We're here for Towelie, fatass!
I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
This is serious, you fucking asshole!
I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
Kyle please, It is not your turn!
You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
Cartman, dude, what's wrong?
Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 
Why not?
Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
Cartman, tell us.
No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
What?!
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
(What?)
You love NASCAR huh?
(Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)
You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
Dude, you are so retarded!
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
Hey Eric.
Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
Ahhh well oh- kay.
But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
Get really psyched up, Butters!
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
NASCA- NASCAR?
I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
You're givin' away all your money??
Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
You sure you want to do this?
I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
Hey Eric.
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
Feel stupid yet?
Not yet.
When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-
Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.
Fucking gross!
For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  "In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss."  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
No, you're good. 
Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
Little boy, what are you doing? 
Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
Really?
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
That was fast.
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
Oh my God! 
Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
Eric, are you sure you can do this?
Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
Let the race begin!
Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
What's that?
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 
It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!
Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 
Eric?
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
Well at least there's that.
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
Aw donkey balls...
You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! 
Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
Oh hey, Kenny.
(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)
Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
(Dude, fuck you!)
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
(No you fucking don't!)
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
(What?!)
I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
Uh, excuse me.  Eric Cartman?
Yeah?
My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.
...Uh oh.
Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you. 
Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-
Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-
Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
You seemed really stupid, Eric.
Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.
Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this "Obama" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
Obama's fuckin' gay.
He's fuckin' gay as hell!
Pissin' me off!
So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
Gentlemen, start your engines! 
Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?
The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.
Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!
Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
The fuck are you doing?!
Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
Oh, son of a bitch!
Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
Oh yeah, I see it. 
AAAAAA! 
You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
That's fuckin' gay as hell.
Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
There you go. You're back on the track.
I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
(Stop this car!)
Get off my car, Kenny!
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
(I fucking hate you!)
Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
Let me talk to her.  Patty? Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty? 
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Fuckin' gay as hell. 
They are neck and neck approaching the finish line. 
Oh, fuck my ass again! 
(HA! You fucking lose!)
No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
Huh?
The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
Oops, busted. 
Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.
Aw, crap, there's more of them?
You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. 
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
Hey, dudes.
Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
What are you talking about?
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
So what?
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
No, it doesn't!
He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
What's strike three?!
You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
No, uh, it just explains a lot.
Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
No, it isn't!
Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
(Yeah.)
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
What the hell are you guys doing?!
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
That's enough!
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
Shoot it! 
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
Are you being serious?
This is very serious, Butters.
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Come on, you guys, hurry!
Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
(What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) 
Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
Why?
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
Dude, what are you doing?
Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
Try to find a way past it!
What does it want?!
Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
Thank you, Kyle.
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
We got him!
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
We need to talk.
Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
Can I help you?
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
Yes?
I need to speak with him, please.
The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
Of what?
I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse.
...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.
Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
Let's hear it, Cartman!
Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
Ahhh.
What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
Yes chef!
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
Lin
Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
What?
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 
Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
So, plug it in.
I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
What happened, Eric?
YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
You said we could.
Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
Oh, sweetie, $900?
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
Eric, we can't afford that one.
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.
Toshiba Handibook??
This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.
Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
Eric!
You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
But I told you I was sorry.
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!"?
Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.
If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!
Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
No!
Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?
Yes! She fucks me so hard!
Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?
Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?
At Best Buy.
Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?
Uh huh.
And people saw her doing this?
Yes!
And they didn't do anything?
No!
Eric, stop it!
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
Booooooo!
Booooooo!
I DON'T!
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
Awwwwww!
You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.
An iPad??? 
When Dr. Phil contacted us at Apple with Eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard.  And so, Eric, here is your very own HumancentiPad. 
Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
Sorry, we have to recall this.
What?! Hey, that's mine!
Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy.  Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh? 
Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
What's this?
President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
What- what am I supposed to s-say?
Ugh, let me talk to them. 
Was machst du? Rück mit die andern. 
Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
Wie ein Fehler? 
Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 
Wollen Sie endlich beutren sein? 
Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 
Zurück! Mit ander, oder sterben! 
Well, I tried.
What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?
Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on "Saturday Night Live"?
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on "Nurse Jackie" and on "Rockin' The Boat."
Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd. 
Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!
Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.
Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
It's kind of funny, you guys.
I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself.
Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
Paradox...
Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
Or will there be?
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
Skeletor's a lady??
Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
Hey Eric.
I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.
Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
Yeah.
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No they didn't.
Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Go look for yourselves!!
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
A conspiracy?
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
Alright.
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
I'm hung like a horse!
Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
Thirteen point seven inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
You just did that to everybody in class!
Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 
Gross!
There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
Oh, Goddamnit!
You're darn right, Eric!
For what?!
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
What?
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
The numbers we put up were height differentials. 
What?
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
I don't know! Why would you?!
We didn't!
Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Because you have an anger problem, Eric!
Fuck you! No I don't!
Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
Excuse me.  Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne-  No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the  Carol? Carol! 
I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.
Why the fuck am I here?!
Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
Oh, that's cool.
No, my, my shit be packing, manh.
My penis is 13 inches long.
Yeeaahh!
Yeah dude!
Yeeaahh!
Yeah!
Burn it down! 
Burn it down, dude! 
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
The Jews!
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
No, and fuck Kyle!
No, please!
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
Wait, what?
America is back!
America is back!
Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
I'm still fucking angry!
Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 
Oh. Hey Kyle.
What are you doing here?
I'm volunteering.
...What are you doing here?!
I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
Why do you have a video camera?
I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
Wuuuuhhhhhh! 
Ah, crap! 
So what are you doing?!
What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
Alright, what is it?!
Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
Why do you need me?
Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
I knew you were doing something terrible!
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
Lots of people will when I tell them!
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
You what?
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
A thousand dollars.
Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.
Come on. 
It's awesome.
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
Every single night.
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
Wow...
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
Betsy MacIntosh?
Whatta you want?
We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
Oh Gohhhd.
We need to speak with you, ma'am. 
It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop! 
Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
The what?
We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
They said it's a boy.
Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
How much will he make?
Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
Cain't you change the rules?
Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being." I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
We're just having a hard time finding him.
Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
I need to talk to you. 
Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
They can't make money. It's against the rules.
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
Gut they're the ones risking injury.
What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
The government could come after us, Cartman.
We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
A hot tub?!
It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
Gravy?
Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
No way.
A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this "poutaine".
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
A what? Send him in. 
Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
In the what?
My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
Are you referring to our student athletes?
Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then?
Look, there are  good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man.
I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
We do  not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves.
But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!
You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
We don't know. He's everywhere.
Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
Oh, that's a good idea.
Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
...What?
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
...What?
This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our "student athletes" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 
You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 
What?
Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 
Vunter Slash?
What?
But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
One of our parents.
But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
One of our parents!
Are you fucking serious? 
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
You knew about this??
Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces. 
I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
Vunter Slash kapunshka. Shpielerin manshunshka. Het mine gaset rosa. Danka Vunter Slasha
He is real, you guys. 
Yay! 
Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
Here you go, sweetie.
Yaaaay!
Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
Oh thanks, dude.
Stan's getting another present, Mom.
Here you are, muffin. 
Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
Gross!
Turn it off dude!
Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
He's lying, dude. Hit X
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
Look like ice cream to me.
I thought you guys were sick! 
...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
Oh cool, the movie trailers!
This November, Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth.  It's Adam Sandler in Pbbbbbt, rated Arg for pirates. Fuck you!
That looks pretty good.
Ugh.
Stan, knock it off!
Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
Hang on guys!
Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
(Are you serious?!)
Yep!
That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
Wait what?
That's what they're talking about on the news!
Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
Yes!
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
Okay, you're on, Jew! 
Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
That's right, it's a butt fungus.
It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
Eric, what is it this time?
Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
You don't feel warm.
Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
Can you lay on your stomach?
I-I'll try. I'll try. 
What the?  What is this? A hamburger? 
A what??
Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
Very funny!
Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
What's the matter dude?
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
Really?
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
Gee, thanks Kyle!
We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?
Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
Thanks!
How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
About three minutes, fatass!
Nice!
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
Everything alright here, Kyle?
Yeah, it's fine.
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 
...K, coming. 
Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?
Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
Better than being a fatass Texan!
Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!
Base! 
Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
Base!
Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
Eh, b-base.
Oh God! 
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
Oh darling, it's wonderful.
No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
What are you talking about?
Where is Butters?
Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
Cartman, what the hell is this?! 
You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
Oh dude. Sweet.
The standard-issue border patrol weapon is the P-29 stun baton. It carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.
This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?
Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
Come on now, come on! You've got it. 
Wait a minute, isn't that...
Game on!
Oh no you don't! 
What the fuck are you doin'?!
That asshole is not getting across my border! 
AAAAH!  I'll get over! 
No you won't Butters!
Ohhh!
Ey!
Mantequilla ayudar ¡1a Border Patrol! 
¡Respeto mi autóridad! 
Border Patrol pegaron ¡El Zero Gordo! 
Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
¡Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...  ¡Oy! ¡Oy!  ¡Orgullo!  ¡Maaantequilla! 
A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
What?
You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
The blond kid?
Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
What about him?
He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
How do you know?!
Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
What's that?
Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 
Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?
Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."
Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
Oh Jesus, what now?! 
Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
Yeah, he killed himself.
Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students,  spearheaded by you, cause him-!
Hey! Whoooa.
Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
Please just let it go.
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.
You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
It's megasuperhilarious! 
Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
What do you want?!
Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
Yeah, it's gross! 
So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
So what?
I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
I don't like you!
I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
You okay, Jenny?
Yeah, I'm fine, I just- Awwgh!  M-Mr. Garrison? Can I please  be excused?
Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
Well okay.
Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
Please! I've gotta go now!
Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
Eeeeww! 
Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
Sick!
WAY worse!
...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
Alright, kewl.
No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!
You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
Yes!
Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
Our students did average, maybe just below average.
Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
That's insane!
Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
NO Wikileaks! Bad!
Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
Eh, Is this one good?
Yeah, I think they're all ready.
You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. 
Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?
No thanks. Okay, proceed.
Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
That. Was. Amazing.
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
Boy, I say.
Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.
Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
Well students, why don't we uh-  Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh!  Aaaah! Oh it's bad!  Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH!  OW!
I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
Do something, you stupid vegan!
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
Four weeks we gotta do this?
Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope. 
Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
Alright, let's go Broflovski. 
Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
Oh grow up.
Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
But Eric, you are cool.
I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?
What do you mean, Peter Panda?
Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl.
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
Mom, have you been here all day?!
No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
Are you sure, sweetie?
Am I sure?? Look at this place!
But who would want to s-
Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
What?
No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 
I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
Shut the hell up, Cartman!
Got something to say Kyle?! 
How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
Where's our five dollars?
Fly bu-what?
Yeah.
Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
Hurry up, screw this.
Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this? 
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl.
I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business.
What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
Sit down, you fucking bitch.
Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
Then why did you write in your diary "It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals" anyway?!
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  Full-on class warfare.
What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
Eh, Eric.
Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.
Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
Why are you involving me in this?
Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
What?! Who?!
I don't know.
I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 
A motion detector. 
Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
Oh sure!
Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
(I don't really know!)
HAAAAGH! 
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
Yeeah!
Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 
Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! 
Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 
Eric! Don't come any closer!
Who did this to you?!
You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
Don't worry, I'll get you down!
No Eric, don't come any- 
AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
It's okay, Eric. It's over now. 
Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up.
...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together.
They were your FRIENDS!
Dead-bolted. Token!  Token, you in there?! 
Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after.
There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric.
Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian.
Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
Thanksgiving is about murder?
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
We all have to do this report together, dude.
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
How is that gonna help?!
Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
And what about the food?  Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? 
Uh-huh??
What??
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
Dude!
Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
They found something. This could be it. 
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
...What?
Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
See what I mean, you guys? 
Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING! 
Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
What hon?
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
Oh no. Oh NO!
What is it, hon?
Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
Oh no!
No!
No!
NO!
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
Yeah, History Channel rules.
The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? 
Uhhh??
Alright, good. Now get in the car! 
Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
Really?
Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
What are you talking about?
Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
Good!
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Eh yeah?
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Heh heh, yeah?
Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
What?
Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
Uh, I won't tell anybody.
Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
My name. Is not. "Kyel."
That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
Hi, sweetie.
Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
Oh, what is it this time? 
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
What, hon?
You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
Oh. 
IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 
Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services.  Here's my head shot.  I just need to get some information from you if that's okay.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.
That's right.
And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here.
Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
We just - no, we just like to have fun here.
Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 
What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?
A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
Could be worse.
How?!
Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?
Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!
Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
Hawaii?
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii.
What??  Greeley?
Come on now! This is not the way we told you to tidy up! Remember? Cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting!  Kenneth, answer the door! 
What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
Hello Eric, your room is upstairs to the left. Are you hungry?
You're my new mom?
You can call me Mom if you like.
Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know for certain if God or Christ existed. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me.
Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!
Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
My name. Is not. Meom!
Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
(I'll be there, Karen.) 
You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
Does he live with you at the foster home?
Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery. 
Really?
Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
(Uh huh.)
Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.
I wasn't making fun of anybody.
A twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven "Yo momma so poor" jokes directed at Jacob Hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks.
I was just teasing.
Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.
My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!
I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, "Oh, look. What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?!" I joke around. This is my head shot. 
Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?
Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.
I'm not saying it.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!
I'm not saying it!
Then we'll add another charge for resisting!
Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
(Good for me.)
There he is, there's my buddy.
How was jail, fatass?!
Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
...What the fuck?!
Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say "No, I found ooone."
No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down!  Thank you. 
Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
Of course, man. It's cool.
Cartman, it was actually really lame.
I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go.
Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
I know, fatass. I was there.
His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
Nuh-uh.
From what?
They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
Mom, get the door! 
Oh sure. 
Who are these buttholes?
It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
This is for your safety. A woman died, you know.
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole. 
Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
Yeah.
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Yeah, you will.
Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
That's right.
Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
Yeah.
It is time for us all to grow up.
That's right.
Yeah.
Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!
Oh boy, here we go.
That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
That's not what I said.
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?
Nice bolo tie, Stan.
Thanks. 
Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
No, dude, it's... badass.
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! 
You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
Dude, that's terrible!
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
But, how do they get away with that?
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
What are you talking about?
For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
That's the chemical equation for gold?
That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
Whoops! 
Butters, what the fuck?!
Sorry. My arms hurt.
"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
Hey! How much will you give me for this? 
Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
Okay. 
We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
I'm not joking.  Do it.
Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
Hello?
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
I'm sorry?
Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
Thank you.
Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"
...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
Goodbye.
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!

Sorry! 
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
Go, go, go.
Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 
I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.
Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
These youths paid with their lives for tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs , bunny ears  and fake wiener  Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you, maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future,  get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember.  Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. Peace signs, bunny ears, and fake wieners. 
Oh, God. That was boring.
So, what do you want to do now?
Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
Hey, did you see today's newspaper?
Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
You guys made the front page.
Really? 
Dude, we are on the front page!
Yes!
Can we get a different pose, please? 
What's it say, what's it say?
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
What? Let me see that. 
"Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
That's all it is? 
You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.
Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. 
How is this Kyle? This good? 
Yep, that's great. 
Cool, these will be good uploads.
Hey, what are you doing?
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else.   Knock it off!
Why don't you make me? 
If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures,  they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. 
Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- 
Dude, what's going on?
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
You guys are sellouts.
Come on, Kyle.
You're freaking sellouts!
It's okay, man, come on.
How droll. 
Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
We have to face it, Cartman.
I know. I know Kyle. 
I really thought it was gonna last.
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
I-It's good that it became something else.
And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
Okay, that's good, a little higher.
Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
Meow.
No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
Meow.
No kitty! That's a bad kitty! 
Alright, go Cartman.
Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
It's super awesome.
Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
Meow, meow.
SHUT UP, KITTY!
Two, one. Go Cartman!
Let's do this. 
Come on, dude. Hurry.
No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
Wow!
We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?
Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
Oh Long Johnson.
Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
So interesting, wow. 
Get out of here.
Oh, hey, Kyle.
Get. Outta here! 
Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
What are you gonna do?
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
No?
Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
What does that have to do with Passover?
All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  "Cartman's Passover Holiday Special", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
(Me, too.)
Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
Jewpa what?
Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
You mean it's like, like a monster?
It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
Nuh-uh!
Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
You guys, check this out! 
Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
AAAAAAHHH! 
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
Butters.
AAAAAHHH!
Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
No, it's a school night!
Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
You think Jewpacabra is here?
Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
Oh God, I'm scared.
JESUS IS A LIE!
Eric, stop it!
Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
Jesus is a lie?
No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Sh! You hear that?
We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
That wasn't a dog?
It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
What?
I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
So where are we heading first?
We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
The Bahamas?
That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
Where to now?
Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
That's what I'm thinking.
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
Jewpacabra?
It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left.
Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
Heh. What do you mean? 
We've never seen this before! It really is true!
Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.
Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.
Why?
If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. 
There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
What are you doing?
Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
Guys?!
It's all quiet out front, Eric.
Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
Hey, Eric.
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
Wingstreet?!
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
Alright, grab him.
HUH?!
You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you. 
Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.
OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
This isn't safe or fun!
Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay?  Oh fuck, we better get out of here. 
NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company.  But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you. 
Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
Bobo shoot it! 
Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 
Alright! Come on, let's go!
Ugh... what... where...
The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
What does that mean?
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
That's just how God is.
You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.
But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?
Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children.
I love you, dad.
And I love you son. And our love grows.
And our love grows
And our love grows
Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile
See it flow
We'll never be apart
Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
This is what God told us to do!
No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
You'll see! 
Noooo! 
What's happening to us? 
Noooooo! 
Mom! Don't let God kill me! 
Noooo! 
Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number...  4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin. 
I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
Yeah.
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
I know, you're not.
Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
Happy Passover, Cartman. 
Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
He has a point.
Good for you, Stan. It's nice somebody in this school has some balls.
I have balls.
Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.
Still balls.
Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.
Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
For a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
And I think I know what we should do to i-it.
Do do do do do to i-it.
Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
Bullying's an ugly thing
Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
We can make it stop. We can stomp it out.
We can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
If if if it ever te-lls.
Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
Oh, you gonna kwy?! Oh don't kwy, you'll look bad with your wittle Captain Kangaroo haircut! 
'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 
Somebody help us! 
We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 
Kyle, hurry! 
For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of "I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining".
Oh God!
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
(What?!)
Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
Cool! Ziplining.
Ziplining. Hell yeah.
Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. 
We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)
Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
All right, you guys look ready to zipline!
Alright!
We don't mind.
Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
Thanks Michael.  Anybody have any questions?
...No.
Jesus Christ!
Finally!
It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear.  His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word "shuttle" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons  that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. 
Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
Dude, did you fart?!
Mmmm, no?
Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
The trees' biology?
Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work.  Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out "Shockabra!", look up and give the camera a nice "shockabra" . Alright, you ready?
Yeah. 
Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
Yeah.
Alright, let's hear you say "Zipliiine!"
Zipliiine. 
Well? How was it, Cartman?
Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
Oh, really??
Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! 
"The next zipline? What are you talking about?"
STOP!
NOOOO!
"Ack" went the little frog one day. "Ack" went the little green frog...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
I'm so fucking bored! 
Woohoo!
We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
Me?!
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
I brought it up because you already brought it up!
You fat piece of shit!
Fuck you Kyle!
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
Yes!
DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
Nnnn-mo...
Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 
Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
Step right out here, we'll get you going.  Got four more for you, Duncan. 
NOOO! 
AAAAH! 
Eeeeugh.
AAAAAAAAAAH!
Uh oh. 
You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
A marina?
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
Stop it! It was me! My idea.
You?!
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
You... You killed Kenny! 
But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. 
It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. 
We were saved. It was over.
After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter.  In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven.  From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express.  Four friends, turn apart by tragedy , would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents.  And the boys received treatment for their herpes. 
No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining.  His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman,  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.
It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
What?
(Yeah, what's her name?)
Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
Theh theh, there she is. 
Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
Nothing! 
What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 
Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
Will you shut the hell up?! 
...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
No!
Huh?
Token, is there a problem? 
Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- 
Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.
So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.
Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
Why?!
Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
About Token? Why?
Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
Token likes Nichole?
W-yeah, of course. 
Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.
Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
Okay.
Thanks, you guys.
Oooo, Kyle.
WHAT?! KYLE?! 
Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. 
Motherfucker! 
We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows! 
Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
Yeah. 
Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
Oh no, who told you that?
Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
Ohhh.
Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
Wow, ah I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.
Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
How come?
Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
Oh, he does?  Okay.
Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
Yeahh, it kind of was. Maybe... uh I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
Cool. Well... thanks again. 
Ohhhhh my God.
We did it, Eric. We found in each other a ray of sunshine.
You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 
Teeheeheehee. 
I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
You motherfucker! 
Kyle, Jesus Christ!
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?
Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
What?!
Nothing.
Who is Cupid Me?!
Nobody.
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.
Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
Teeheeheehee, heeheehee.
Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
Sorry. 
That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
Heeheeheeheeheehee.
Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. 
I'm gonna get you! 
Heeheehee, no! 
I almost got you! Almost! 
Everything okay, sweetie?
Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
Okay. 
It's not fair! They were so... happy!
It's gonna be okay, Eric.
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
They'll find love somewhere else.
No, they won't!
Yes, they will.
No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
And you! I should never have believed in you!
In...in who, Eric?
I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too!  I can't be constipated on the job.  That's why I need... Soft Serve.  Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough.  Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work!  'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!
That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
No, you don't. 
Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
Teehee, stop it.
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
Heeheehee, heeheeheehee,  Heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee.
Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game.
Denver Nuggets game?
Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy.
NOOOOOOO! 
O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars-
Nooooooo!
Awww! 
NOOOOOOO. 
Tickets please.
No time! NOOOOOOO!
We're all set for the tipoff. 
Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
Awwwww. 
I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
I swear, Kyle.
I swear, Kyle. 
He did that? Oh no.
Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
YAY! 
Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 
Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place.
That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you!
Really?!
There she is! 
What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you! 
Hey, stop it!
Haaagh! 
Nooo!
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
That's right, Butters.
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
That's true.
Yeah! Yeah!
Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
We don't have a coach, Kyle.
Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
That's IT! 
Hey Butters, you got a minute?
Wuh sure, Eric. 
I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
...I don't have a dad.
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
Youuu save it all?
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
Do you feel warm and compassionate?
Holy shit I think I do.
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
I'm not fat, Kyle.
Right, you're not fat.
Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
Excuse me.  Excuse me! 
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
You've gotta be kidding me!
Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 
Why? 
I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
Oh no!
Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
You don't need that! Get off of it.
Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
What??
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
So take a shit somewhere else!
That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
What's going on down here?
Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...
Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
I don't have legs.
Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.
The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. 
Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
You have got to be kidding me!
What, Kyle?! 
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
Come on, hurry it up in there! 
Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! 
It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention.  A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo! 
You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!
That's good, Fatty, get pissed!
I'm pissed!
Yeah, Fatty!
Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
Ow!
I ain't done with you, bitch!
We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity! 
Oh! You fucking bitch! 
Whoa!
Dude, no way!
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
What?
Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
Cartman dude, not now.
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all.
Oh no, really?
Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.
What-what do you mean?
Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.
Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
Okay, I've got something a little different here.
Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
No problem.
Sorry about this.
It's all right, it happens all the time.
'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
You want to rape your mom?
That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
You said you lived there.
I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
Hey, ey uh,  you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!
You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
Oh-kay, should we contact the police?
Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
Okay, we're contacting them now.
He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!
Thought we wouldn't find out??? 
Who is there?
Please! 
Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?
Hello, this is Varashnu wit Wolf Home Security.
A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
...Uh yes, I am in United States.
Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
Okay, hold on. 
Heh- hello?
This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.
Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.
Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.
Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
I know...
HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
What?!
Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
What?  Hello?
This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
All right, could I just get your password please?
Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
I love boobs?
No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs.
How did you know that?
My password is uloveboobs!
Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
Sure, here you go. 
Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-
God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back.  Ah! Who are you??
It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
Hoo!
FELLAS! Fellas!
What?
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
Butters?  Why?
It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
You're talking about Butters.
Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
...Wow.
Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. 
Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
What?
Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
Hawaii?
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
(I'm not his best friend.)
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
(Yeah.)
Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style. 
Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
You'll just have to wait and see.
Stan can't come.
Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!" 
Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. 
I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 
The Incredible...
Ohhh, cute!
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!
That's right!
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
Dude dude dude! Check it out. 
Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
You guys, we've gotta stop it!
Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
Cartman SMASH! 
Who are you?!
Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
It's all right, just a scratch.
Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
Okay, roll up your sleeve. 
I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 
All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
Did you do it?
Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
(I told you it was a bad idea.)
Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
Uh huh.
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet!
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
Yeah I know.
Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
All right, it was Craig. 
Craig?! You asshole!
Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay.  Uh hey kids. Kids over here...
Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
Yes you do. 
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!
Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound.  That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent.  My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!
...Fuck! Dude, weak. 
Okay, Mr. Thompson, voting line is right over there.  Next, please. 
Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?
MOM!
This little boy lost his mom.
She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
It's all right, come on. 
Mom? Where's my mom?
Would you like some warm nuts, sir?
"Warm nuts", she said.
Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?
No way dude. No way.
Would you like warm nuts, sir? 
Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
Hey Kyle. What's up?
Nothing, watching the election results.
Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
What?!
Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
Sure you do!
What if I did, Kyle?
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
Pretty sweet, huh?
What the hell is this?
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
I don't believe it.
No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
Why do you have these?
Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
Dude!
Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
Knock it off, Cartman!
Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
Hmmm, no.
You mind if we search your room?
I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
Let's just see. 
Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
Upstairs! First door to the left!
I know my rights! Stop right now! 
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
More melted butter, sir?
Mm, mhm, mhm.
Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?!
They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!
Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle. 
So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!
Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha.
Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
I didn't say anything. I promise.
I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
Go on! Leave us alone! Haha.  Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need-
Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.
Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?
I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
Like what?!
I want a part in the new movies!
Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha.
I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle.
Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.
Haha.
Haha.
Haha. 
I am tired of playing games! This little farce is ovah! 
I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?
Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out. 
No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
How many hours were you guys playing?
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
You were playing football?
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Kyle, this is a private conversation.
Is that that same kid?
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
How do we have a choice?!
Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
My dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
Who is that? Is that Toby
Yeah.
Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
Yeah, we're ditching school.
You're what? What, you say?
Me and Toby are ditching school!
I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"?
I don't think so.
See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 
That'd be cool.
That'd be what?
That'd be COOL.
I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my "Stop Listening To Me" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
I said I got your tweet and the address!
Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
Yeah, I'm here, bro.
Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
They're spying on you?
Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, "you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek." I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
Like what?
Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
Naw, don't do that.
No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
You need that new thing where you don't need to type.
What, they already have something better than Twitter?
You haven't seen the Alec Baldwin commercial?
No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
How many people are on Shitter?
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
Can I help you sir?
Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
All right, and your name?
Bill Clinton.
I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.
Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
Uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?
I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office.
Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
Some little faggot in my head.
Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.
Really? How big is my file?
Huh?
Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as "fat and unimportant."
Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet."  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! 
Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
Not according to the Central Computer.
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
Sorry,  but if Central Computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything. 
Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
There's 300 million people out there. How do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? How do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?
I don't know.
Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this.
Get their hands on what?  Dude... 
This is how we know who's a threat and who's not. How we know who's sleeping and who's awake.  How we know that...
You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
Hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on MSNBC, "Free Pass with Alec Baldwin"
You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
Eric, honey, what's the matter?
It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 
Honey, it's okay.
It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! 
No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
I do toooo!
No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
What's this?
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
I can be forgiven?
Yes.
For everything bad I've ever done?
Yes!
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
That's right.
Thta's pretty kewl.
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
I do, I love my country!
Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!
Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
Murder porn?
That's more like it.
What's up dude?
Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.
What?
Butters' dad killed his mom. 
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! 
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
Aw, go to hell, you griefer!
Alright, we've gotta do something.
What, dude?
Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"
So?
You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
(I knew you're up to something!)
Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
I love you too babe.  OH!
Hey Token!  What's up, bro?
Nothing.
"Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?
Yeah.
Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-
Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
He's doing it a-gain.
Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
I uhhh, have band practice.
God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
Cartman, are you feeling alright?
Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 
Alright, now the French Revolution was basically started by a young man named Marius. , who only knew Jean Valjean as an older man, and uh-  ...uh, the French government at the time was led by Javert, who was trying to-
Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 
Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
M'kay.
No! Nonono!  Nooo! 
Hey Token? How are you doing?
I'm good.
That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
Okay, really?
No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! 
Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
Agreed.
Okay. Token, come on in, please. 
Hoh boy, here we go.
Token, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?
Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
...What jury?
This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
I don't know what to say.
I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called "I Was Not The Bullet." 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
"Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?"
I was not the verdict.
This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
Eric, do you feel better about all this?
Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
Okay, thanks Token. 
It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch. 
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
White people say Ho-oh!
Ho-oh.
Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
Ho ho!
Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"
Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!
Token, calm down.
What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
Get inside! 
Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
What's going on?!
Get to an airport!
An airport?! But...?
We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 
Now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
Which one?
Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
My God, what's going on out there?
The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! 
Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
What contagion? My wife didn't get on the plane.  Take this plane back to Denver!
You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 
What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?
Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
You got a better idea, asshole?!
Everyone quiet! I have to think!
Yes, let him think!
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
Oh, I'm just finishing up.
Nah! 
Hey!
One of them is in the back!
No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
Help! Help me!  Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them!
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.
His name is Token.
We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it.  Promise me! Promise... me!
Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
Yes!
Come on! 
Can I help you?
Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?
A person. 
...You mean a person who's threatening you?
Threatening all of us!
Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.
Stand my ground?
See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.
This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!
The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
This plane is going to Baltimore.
If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
What are we going to do?
I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
What if he attacks us first?
Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
So what?!
Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
Fuck you!
Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 
Oh! 
That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 
What's up girls? Daddy did it!
Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
Yeah. So bad.
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
You're a murderer.
You interrupt people when they talk.
Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.
Oh man! 
Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.
Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
Token, calm down.
And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
Oh God, here we go again! 
Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future.  M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink.  Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.  M'kay...  You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school.  Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on "school clinic" Mkay, see nurse. M'kay. Respiration problems.  Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay.  It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board.  Mesage... board.  Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance,  here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski.  Okay, little Ike says "My brother is a homo" Ike made a little drawing of his brother too.  Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice.  It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
He doesn't even let me near him!
That sucks, dude.
What??
I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
Yaaaay!
Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
About what?!
I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
Where did you find a red-haired cow?
Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
Whoa, look at it!
You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
Wow, that's pretty trippy.
Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 
Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 
What? What joke? This is real!
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
Thank you, Butters! 
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
Don't touch it! 
Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."
Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. 
Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
Yeah. 
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
No shit!
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
Dude, go to Hell!
You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
You're a fat skank, Mom. 
Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
I just... thought it'd be nice.
Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
Yes sir.
Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
You what??
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
Let's see. Oh! Oh! 
Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
Kyle, are you sure?
Please...
Well alright. 
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
I don't care.
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks! Things just keep getting better here, Tom. And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!
You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
Yes! Yes I will!
Huh? You comin'? 
Yes, whatever you want. 
Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
And now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, Eric Cartman, and his best friend, Fartboy. 
Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
Small penis?!
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
But it's the truth!
No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
That's enough!  Our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! Those of you who signed up are to be... commended.  But I warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors!  Winter is coming.
Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
(She's not here right now.)
Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
Which nobody can afford.
What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.
Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
Larry and Brad Stoltsky
But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?
Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
What do you mean?
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? 
That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
What?
M ma um m-me too.
...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
That's right.
They're not better, they're just more expensive.
We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
Yeah!
Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
I know.
Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. 
On screen. 
Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
God these guys are such dorks!
Just find out who they're loyal to.
Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.
Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
I don't know.
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
What new Elmo doll?
Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. 
Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
(Yes. What's up, my lord?)
I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
(Yes. That's right.) 
You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
Hey, you damned kids!  Get the hell out of my yard!
Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
What's going to be the big item everyone goes for this Black Friday? It just might be the PlayStation 4. Sony has just announced they offering a special Black Friday bundle, called the "Brack Friday Bunduru," which will include four controllers, a map of Japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for Metal Gear Solid V. No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes.
Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
En garde! 
Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 
Aaah God ow sorry...
There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 
Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!" 
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 
Smartasses. 
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
They don't!
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
Yeah, I finished it!
So what happens when the dragons show up?
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
Wha-what do you want me to do?
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
Who's George R. R. Martin?
He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damned yard!
Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
Yeah?! Well home come every time you talk to somebody. it's about betraying somebody else?!
Why don't you mind your own business?!
Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in Game of Thrones. 
Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?
Grounded? For what?
That could be up to you.
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
What?
Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Don't believe it!  He said that to a bunch of people!
Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
You're callin' the cops?!
Yeah!
You're on my property! I'm callin' the cops!
Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
Yes?
Hi, is Kenny home?
Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 
Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
That doesn't even make sense.
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
Ehhh...
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?
Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.
Your CEOs?
Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Uhhh, hmmm. What?
Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
Aaaaah! 
He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
Because, because what? Because he's cute?
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
So what are you saying, Kyle?!
Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
Haha.
Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
Ha? Ueddingu? 
Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
Ahh, kawaii! 
Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
Yeah, sure, what about it?
I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 
Why?
Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
He's lying to you!  They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!
Dude! Dude!
They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching Game of Thrones!
Dude, shut the fuck up!
Who is that?
He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
They're gonna lock you in!
God damn it, shut up!
He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
Did Kyle know about this?
Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
Did Kyle know about this?!
Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!
Fuck you, get out of my garden!
I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
What's that?  Awww! 
Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?
Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!
Yesh, kewl.
So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?
Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
Yes, he did.
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
What the hell did you do??
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
Oh great, go right on in. 
Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?
The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
Yeah, come on!
Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
What the hell is this?!
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.
Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
They're not a part of your betrayal?
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
No. Whose betrayal is this? 
Winner take all!
Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
This... is over... Now... you die!  It's over. XBox... wins! 
Yay, XBox wins.
Happy holidays, guys. What can I interest ya in? 
We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.
The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. 
You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
Yeah, you're right. You make a point.
Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
Yeah!
Fuck 'em!
At least she didn't try to sit on him. 
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right
Uh oh.
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
What?! Well since when?
Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. 
Wow! Wow! She looks great!
Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. 
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
(Commentary?)
There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
What do you think you're doing?!
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
Let's Plays?
That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. 
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 
CartmaaanBrah!
So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
And why do you think young people-?
CartmaaanBrah!
...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 
CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass!  Oh, this is going on Instagram! 
Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.
Tell me about it.
Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
Oh God.
Do you mind?!
Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
What the hell?
This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
It's true!
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
What the hell did I do?
Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
Eric, I am talking to YOU!
Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?
Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!
Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!
Barking vaginal belch.
Protruding vaginal boner.
(Dilapidated titties incorporated.)
Oh, I like that. 
Sorry.
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
I told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. There's a lot of startup company these days. 
Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
...Nnnno, there isn't. 
You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
What?
It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
What?! Tell us!
Washington. Redskins. 
Washington Redskins?
It's sooo sweet!
I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
What?!
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
(Yahoo!) 
I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
No way!
Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.
By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.
Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
You are Eric Cartman?
Yes, I know.
My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
Thank you, but I will stand.
Nice, I like that.
Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.
Stop? But why?
Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!
Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization "The Washington Redskins", its offensive to us?
How is it offensive?
Makes us feel like a joke
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 
Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? 
Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
That's the Catholic Church!
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
That's the NFL!
It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
Maybe I'll start my own company.
Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
Thank God!
Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls". It's just a bold new way that we can say "We don't fucking care." Go Redskins! 
Huh? 
Goooood morning, guys!
Happy Deadline Day!
We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
What?!
Somebody killed Kickstarter!
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 
You song of a bitch!
What?!
You broke Kickstarter!
No, I just can't get it to load.
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
Well, somebody did!
He's right. We should do a merger.
A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 
Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
It is really sweet.
Whattaya say, Cartman?
Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 
We finally did it!
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
What the heck is that? 
Whoa, whoa! What?
Well what the hell do we do?
I guess we gotta go back to school. 
Morning!
How's it going, everybody?
Sup, Jason? 
Hey dude. Sup? 
What are you guys doing here?
What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 
Dude, people are pissed off at us.
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
(A party?!)
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
What?
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
(This will be awesome!)
So who do we throw the party for?
Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?
You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
I actually have plans this weekend.
"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."
All the pizza we can eat?
Believe it, dude.
Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
What the hell is gluten?
Hey Cartman.
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
Dude, calm down.
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
KYYYLE!
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
We can't let our party suck.
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
I'll be back. 
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
Hello, Eric.  Come on over here, sugar.
Aunt Jemima. 
There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.
I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.
I don't even know what that means.
When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.
Are you going to eat those pancakes?
They've got it wrong, child!  The world is upside down.
Oooo, trippy...
Tell then they've got's it backwards!
They've got what backward? 
Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?
KYYYLE!
Cartman?
KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
Who is this?
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure?  Bring up the pyramid! 
What, what is it? What is it for?
The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
It's upside down.
What?
Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.
Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 
We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
Are you okay, Cartman?
Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
Good for you. 
I think someone's in there.
No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
Occupied.
I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
You can't call dibs on a toilet.
Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm going to the potty.
This is the girls bathroom!
Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
WHAT?!
Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
GET OUT OF HERE!
Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 
Cartman is using our bathroom!
Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!
It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. 
I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Alright, listen Eric!
Erica.
Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
Yeah! Recess is almost over!
There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
Not while you're in here!
Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.
Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 
If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 
Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
Would that be agreeable to you?
OH MY GOD!
Wendy, just go with it!
Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?
Oh on that side?
You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.
Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls." 
Holy moly! 
Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
It's cool. I'll wait.
Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!
I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
I thought you were a chick.
No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
What?
Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating  "I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me." Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week.
Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
Awe, come on, lay off him guys.
Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 
I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
No it isn't.
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
That's stupid.
You can see the momma bird fly in.
I'm dying of boredom.
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
What did you say?
You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
Your dad has a fucking drone?
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
You wanna take it out for a spin?
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
Butters?
Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.
Comin' dad! 
Butters, is that you?
Yes, it's me.
Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
Of course not!
Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 
What?! You said nobody would know!
It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
Be careful! The powerlines!
Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 
Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
Let me see!
Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
Jeeeeezz!
This thing is recording, right?
(Yeah.)
Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 
What do I do?!
His dad sees you!
I don't know what to do!
Fly back to the house, stupid!
I love you too, Dad. 
Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
(Yeah, I know, dude.)
Not a word, Kenny!
I know. 
Hey you guys.
Sup? 
You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
What?
Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? 
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
Let me see.
Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
How'd you get that on your phone?
Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
That's terrible!
I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
What the heck are you doing?!
Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Butters-
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
Butters. Butters.
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
WHY?!
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! 
Are you happy now?!
What? 
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
What does that have to do with me?
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
You were what?!
I was in the bathroom-
You were spying on me?!
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
How is that spying?!
You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
Butters.
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Because, Butters-
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
Why?!
Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page,  it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!
Oh hey Butters. Sup?
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Dude, what's the matter?
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
Butters.
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
You do?
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
What?
Your dad's drone.
NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO!
Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
If this doesn't work, we're dead.
It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
But then when drones were filling the sky,
She unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Gargantuan thicket of madness.
Bigger than earth and denser than gold.
Truly a magical bush to behold.
Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  "Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."
Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
You're welcome. 
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
What are you two boners doing?
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
Yes.
Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
Jimmy told me about this game.
Dude, what?!
The?!
(Yeah!)
Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
That makes sense.
We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
It's done. 
Wuh, what's done?
The word is out.  "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it.  It's trending.
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
Cool.
I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? 
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
What what what?
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
I'm sorry!
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
Yeah.
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
Okay, I'm back in your room!
Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
Suppornity window dropped. 
Welcome back, dude.
Wow! That was cool!
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
I touched Wendy's boobs. 
And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back."  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
Sound pretty typical to me.
Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
Coup de grah, Cartman
Thank you, Kyle.
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
Yeah. 
See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
Well, not a hundred percent...
Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 
Okay, subject is ready.
Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
Interim status is go.
Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Going now! 
Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
Just take the money, Butters! 
Okay, I got it!
You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
Already? Oh no!
Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
Huh, that was incredible!
Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
What the hell are you doing, Kid?!
Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
Wait, hang on Butters!
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
Butters?? Butters?? 
I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
Butters. 
Ahhh!
Are you okay?
Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
I'm not here, Butters.
What?
This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.
Nuh uh!
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
WHAT?? 
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!
Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
Ah how do you know that?!
How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 
O-kay. 
Butters.
NO!
I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
With what?
This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
Fuck you!
You should probably listen to him, dude.
Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
Maybe we are.
Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! 
Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! 
Are you fucking with me?!
...What? What do you mean?
Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
I don't know what you mean.
Because if you are, it's not cool!
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
Oh gosh!
That's right!
OH GOSH!
THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
Yeah.
Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 
Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? 
It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 
Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
I know. Let's go to the backyard. 
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Okay Kyle.
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Mmmhmm.
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
Www-what do you mean?
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
Fuck you!
I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
Don't... do that!
Calm down.
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
In virtual reality, yes you did.
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
Fuck!
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
Or if I did?
Dude... What?
What?  Hello?
Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
How do you know?
Because... I'm a computer program.
God damn it Cartman!
I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
He's lying.
I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
YES.
You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 
Hey guys.  Thanks. Support your team? Thank you. Hey guys. Did you get one of these?  Hope you can make it.
What's this?
The girls volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
What's wrong with supporting girls athletics?!
Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
This asshole needs to make a move already!
What's that?
He's playing an enchantment.
Nnoohhh!
Dude, it was complete brutality!
It was seriously almost hard to watch. 
At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
Pfft whatever.
Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
Hey! Pssst!  Come over here.  You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here.  This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet.  And you might wanna pack a barf bag.
Kewwwl!
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp? 
(What?)
Dude, do we look like police?
Okay, come on, come on, five darra, five darra each! Come on, five darra!
Five darrar? 
The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
Dude, that was total carnage!
That was freakin' hardcore.
Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
We're going again on Friday, right?
Hell yeah! 
What's the matter Kenny?
What's mean about it?
You feel bad for the roosters?
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
(No.)
Huh? A little bit?
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 
What is it?!
Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?
They're fuckin' chickens.
Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?
Then he's perfect for us.
What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
"Yes I do, you guys."  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
Yeah!
All right McNuggets!
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls volleyball.
Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.
Thank you so very much.
Gee, thanks!
You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
Where was all this?
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.
Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
OOHHH!! 
Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 
Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 
Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
Oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.
Ten darra?! 
For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky
Who is that??
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
McNuggets is scared, dude!
He doesn't have a choice
This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
What do you think all these people are here to see?
Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move.  Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card. 
Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
He just had to shuffle it.
Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randi! 
Ah, dude, your dad's here.
All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
And featuring live commentary the entire show by CartmanBrah.
CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
He's such a douchebag.
It's all live and it's all magical. It's the Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special.
Now we're talkin'! 
Nnnothing, nothing.
Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. 
Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down.
Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
Sir, I'm pretty sure that  "Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special" is not a good name.
No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power!
I can hear you, douchebag.
People, you know what we're trying to do here.  We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now.
These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
There, you see that? "Blumpkin catchers." Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs.
G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
Cartman, open this door right now!
Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
What the hell are you doing?!
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
How do you even know I'm here in my room?
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. 
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
Why does that matter?
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
What?
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 
And now, live via hologram, it's Kurt Cobain. 
Oh, this should be good.
Up on the housetop, reindeer pawsOut jumps good ole Santa Claus
I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, girls and boys 
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go
Yeh-he-he-eah who wouldn't go 
Up on the housetop clickity click click 
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick? 
Hoh, this should get some comments. 
And now, together at last, Iggy Azalea and Elvis. 
Oh bros, weak!
Pfffffffft
Oh weak, bros, so weak!
Maybe we should turn it off.
Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?  This looks pretty stupid.
What the heck? 
CartmaanBrah!
Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
He's trending more than we ever thought possible.!
Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
Damn it, you're ruining the show!
Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
We can't, sir!
I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
It's all CartmanBrah now.  I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender.  Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
Hey! What's going on? What is that? 
How's it goin' bros? This is PewDiePie!
What the hell?!
Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out.
Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
God damn it, get out of here!
Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting?
Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
I know! Let's play Call of Duty! 
No! You can't do this!
Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros!
God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him!
NOOOO! 
Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
Yeah, go home you little dildo.
Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
I know what it means!
Well, what?
I'm not telling you.
(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 
He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  Ow! 
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Really? What about?
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.  Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open,  and the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.  Then I was lying on a table,  and these scary hands wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes...
Totally!
What?
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
Kick ass.
Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
Huh?
Yeah, fat boy saw it!
Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
Oh!
Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
Oh!
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
No!
Eneh probe
Shut up, dildo!
Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control. 
Oh!
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?
Shut up!
Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
Shut up you guys, it's not working.
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
Somebody's baking brownies. 
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.
Damn it!
Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.  Ow! My ass! 
Damn, Cartman!
Uh... Ow! My ass!
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
No, that was just a dream.
Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine. 
Ya, seriously, killer.
Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
Where? 
Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
Or slip her the tongue.
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
You are making it up. 
Whoa! 
What?
It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us.
Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?
Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children.
Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!
We got out of schoolNo more school todayWe got out of school...
Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control! 
I love to singa
About the moona and June-a and the springa
I love to singa
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
Ah, son of a bitch!
Hey!
Uh...
If you visitors can hear me- 
Hey...
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
Ow!  That hurts, you buttlicker!
Now do you believe us, Cartman?
No!
Cartman, they killed Kenny!
He's not dead.
Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?
Shut up, you guys.
He's dead, Cartman! 
God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Dildo!
Hello, Eric.
Hi, Mom.
How are you doing?
Well, I'm pissed off!
Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
You're not fat, you're big boned.
That's what I said.
You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
No!
Just a weensy geensy woo woo?
No, Mom, leave me alone! 
How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
What? Well, that does sound pretty good.  Uh, Mom?
Yes, hon?
If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?
Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns. 
Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
Meow.
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
Meow.
No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!
Meow.
No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!  Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.
What?
Meow.
No, Kitty, you can't have any!
Meow.
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!  Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.
Eric, look who's here.
Dude, weak mom.
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
I can't, my mom said...
That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--
Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
God damn it! 
Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Oh, man, this sucks.
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Ow!
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Come on Cartman, fart!
I don't wanna.
Fart, damn you!
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!  I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
Now, do you believe this, Cartman?
You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
Sure, you guys, what-ever. 
Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!  Oh, God damn it!
Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)
What the hell are they talking about?
Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)
You guys, get me down from here!  Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 
I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a
I love to sing-a
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...
Puh!
Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
Really, what about?
Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?
Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
Ahh, son of a bitch!
Yeah, it was huge.
Heh, I hate those things.
Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, "Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!" 
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Ohh, rainbows. Yeah, I like those, those are cool.
What were you talking about?
Heh, oh, nothing, forget it.
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Nothing..!
What?
What?
Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
Kick ass!
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.
Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
Oh, you know, this and that.
My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
Ouch.  Thank you.
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Hey!
Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
That kid is me.
Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?
Me! Eric Cartman!
How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?
Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.
We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
Dolphins are way smarter than you!
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!
Dolphins, eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
Tell me what you wrote about!
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
Screw you, hippie!
Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!

Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!
Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.
Hey dudes.
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff. 
What's that stuff?
Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Superfatass?
Hey, I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!  Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
No they don't, you jealous weakling!
God damn, that's a big fat ass!
Hey!
Hi guys.
Oh look, another hippie.  Peace, Wendy.
Shut up Cartman!
Oooh, Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...
Where is she?
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!
Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
He's got a gun!
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman...
Cartman, God damn it.
It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?
Here it is, my big moment of fame.
I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.
But I won the environmental essay contest.
Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.
When is this going to be on the air?
Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
Okay, Mom.
Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 
Dude, that's sick mom.
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 
Drive, Drive!
You give your mommy a kissy.
Drive the car damn-it, drive!
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
Oh, ho, that's disgusting.
You piece of crap, I'll kill you! 
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
Eeeh!  
Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
Hey, I didn't get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
Wow, that'd be cool.
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
Democrats piss me off!
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  
Kickass!! 
I guess so.
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
What?!
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
Shoot it Stan.
I got your back, soldier.
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
I can shoot you, fat ass!
I can shoot you too!
I'll kill you!
I'll fill you full of lead!
What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 
My weenies won't cook.
Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.
Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.
Hah, got ya.
Heh, that's not scary.
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
Yeah, Cartman's pee.
Hey, you would taste my pee!
Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?
Whatabutt?
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
Why?
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Deformed how?
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…
A knife.
No! A piece of celery.
Celery?
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Hey, it might be!
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!
Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Kumbayah my lord, kumbayah. 
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah. 
Moh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah...
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!
Look!
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
This calls for some HJ-14.
Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
Fire in the hole!
Holy crap! 
Damn it, I think I missed
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
C'mon, let's move, move!
Hey, wait, aah!
Look, up there.
You guys, it's just me.
I can't tell; let's kill it!
Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.
That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Hey, seriously you guys!
You pansy! give me that gun.
Hey!
Cartman?
Goddammit, don't shoot me!
What in Sam Hell?
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
Help! 
Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 
Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
He's not meaner than Sparky.
Oh yeah, let's see. Hey, Sylvester. 
Sparky'll kick his ass.
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! 
Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
What?!
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
What do you mean?
That dog is a gay homosexual.
Sick, shut up dude. 
Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. 
Who's Middle Park?
What's homecoming?
Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?
There he goes again.
Get down Sparky! Down!
Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
Gay dog. 
...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Thank you for that presentation Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a "D-".
Ah, dammit!
Excellent. "A-".
Eeyy!
Wow, cool!
Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an "A-"?
Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.
That's not fair!
Life isn't fair kiddo, get used to it.
Stupid puppet. 
Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
Bark, bark.
Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.
I don't know.
He still looks pretty gay to me.
Oolala 
There he goes.
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!
I think he might've run away.
Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!
Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in.
We'll just see about that.
Cartman farted!
No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
Ah, dude, weak.
That's right, you get back there.
But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
Mroo- 
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
Your sister beat you up again, huh?
No!
Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Be a man Stan.  Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."
No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"
SIT DOWN KID!!!
Yes ma'am.
We can use Cartman's pig.
Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
This must be it. 
Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
Yeah, quit being such a baby.
Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
At least I'm not a little pigfucker!
Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
I'll kick you in the nuts!
I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Oh, uh, I suppose so uh.  Oh yes, over here.  Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!  Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.
You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 
Come on Fluffy! 
Naw, it's pretty fresh.
UUuuhh.  I sure am hungry.
'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?
Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue…
God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.
Righto. 
Gah, French people piss me off.
Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 
Ugh!…Hey! I'll kick your ass! 
Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
Whaaat?!
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!" 
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!
Come on Kenny.
Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
Sick!
Fluffy!
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!
Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.
You can't just leave me here alone.
Oh yeah, watch me. 
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.
Hmmm. You boys get first prize.
That'll do pig.
Oh no. 
Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
Ow! What the hell was that for?!
That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
Pay attention children!  I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.
What?
Wow!
Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
(Oh my God!)  (Owww!) 
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
Yeah...
Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.
What!
And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.
Hey!
Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Don't talk about my mom like that!
I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?
Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
Kyle, don't be such a butthole!
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Oh, biiitch.  Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
Oho yeah, I love beans.
Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
Well, don't fart on me Terrance.
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
(Oh my God!) 
Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.
(Ow!)
Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
What are they doing in there?
I don't know.
'Kay, come on guys. 
Why don't we just shoot him?
Ahhh! 
Aaaah, runrunruuun! 
Quick, jump through the window.
Ehh, eh, ehhhh! 
Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.
Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on. 
We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
And now back to She's the Sheriff.
Ohhh, God, No!
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Cool!
Yeah! 
You bastards!
What the hell is that thing?
It looks like a UFO.
There's no such thing as UFOs. 
Let's get 'im to the morgue. 
Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Wow! Cool!
Hey, dudes.
Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
Where'd you get that?
My mom made it, isn't it cool?
No it's not cool!
What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!
Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. 
I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off! 
Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?
Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!  Poor piece of crap.
Huhuh.
There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
Wookies don't live on Endor!
Wookies don't live on Endor.
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
What?! What did you say?!
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Eating Kenny's pudding.
Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?  Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!  Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!
Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
Where did you get that costume, young man?!
My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Sshh! Oh, God bless America.  You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. 
Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-
Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
Now, do you have any questions?
Could I see that again? That was cool.
You must remove that costume, immediately!
I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.  Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?
I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around. 
Boo! I'm a ghost.
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
Hello, children.
Hey Chef.
Aaaaah! 
Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?
Whoa, dude!
What is that?
Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.  Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers. 
Who?
Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
Check.
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
Yeah, granola pisses me off. 
Hey Kenny.
Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
You still didn't get a costume Kenny? 
Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.  I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!  I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
Hi guys.
Hi Wendy.
Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.
You what?! Are you insane?!
Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.
How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911! 
Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!
Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.  Aaah!  Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah! 
Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
Trick-or-treat. 
Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
Can we have some candy now please?!
Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
If everyone is turned into zombies...
Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!
The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue. 
It was Kyle.
Yeah, I'm scared.
Remember candy, focus on the candy.
See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
Eh, shit...
We told you dude.
You guys, shit...
Piiink eye!
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
Hey, there's a pay phone!
Welcome to the Worcestershire Sauce customer service hotline. For Worcestershire sauce recipes please press 1 followed by the pound sign. For Worcestershire sauce product placement, please press 2. If Worcestershire sauce has been used as embalming, please pr... 
Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!  Aaah, kew!
Aaahahah!
Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!
I know, but uh-... but...
Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
Kill her Stan!
You did it children!
Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. 
Oh.
Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
Yeah.
Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
Sure hon.
And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!
AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
Yeah, HEY!
For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.
That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
KICK ASS!!
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
When do we get the sports watch?
Just a second fat-ass!
You vas-deferens!
Cool.
I get to wear it first, you guys.
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
Exactly.
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
Many would rather die than go to those places!
Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!
Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
The digital sports watch is here.
What the hell?
I think he said his name is Marvin.
Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
Hey mooom?
Yes hon?
We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
Sure, hon.
Sweet. 
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Totally. 
Ahh!
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
Ap-ee-tizer.
This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
Yeah, yeah, we do!
Yeah, that's right.
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.
Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch.
Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up.
Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin! 
Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
So please, call and adopt a child today.
I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
Sweet.
Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! 
Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!  I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding. 
What?!
We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up.
But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch.
WEEEEEEAK!!!
Does my hair look okay?
Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...  I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.  Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.  Huh, I wonder what's in here?  SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!  Sally Struthers?!
Who the hell are you?!
Gimme that cake!
Nooho, this is my cake!
No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!
NOO! You can't have any!
No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!  You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! 
We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.
That's right you will, God-Damnit.  Move it POVs, I'm an American!
It's a boy! 
Oohhhh!
Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!
Oh dude!  Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
Shut up, fat boy!
I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
Christmas Poo?
What the hell is Christmas Poo?
That was sick, dude!
Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.
Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 
Yeah!  Yeah!
Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!
It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
Never mind him.  He's a very disturbed little boy.
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
How do you know?
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
What's that?
I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
It's a surprise.
Let me see! 
Dude, sick!!! 
Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play.  The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.
Thanks to Kyle's mother.
So does anybody know  any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.  Yes, Eric?
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
Mr. Hankey.
Monday she's a bitch, 
on Tuesday she's a bitch, 
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different, 
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!
Golly, that isn't very nice.  I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair, 
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BI-I-I-ITCH - aahh.
What the... 
Gross, Kyle!
Uuuuuuhh...
YOU SICK BASTARD! 
Jacket! 
Bye, Kyle!  Happy Channukah!
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
What? Why?
'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!  Howdy, folks.  Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery.
Whoa!!
Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!
Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!
Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me.  Bye-bye and Merry Christmas 
Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!
Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
Yeah, something feels...unfinished 
Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
What is this, Cartman?
They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
That's right.
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
That's ri-aayy.
Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.
Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!  Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
Children, children! Today is a very special day.
No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
Eeeeeeh!
Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.  Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
Damn, what a freak!
Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? 
Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Yeah, that's weak!
Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 
Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. 
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
Quack-quack.
Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!
Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 
This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.
Commercial
Who will win our souls? . Our Savior and Lord?  Or the Prince of Darkness?  It's the final battle between Good and Evil  and it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95
Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
Cartman's birthday!
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
I a - pologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice. 
Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 
Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.
You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
Come on, kiddies. Eat more.
Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles. 
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!
Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
Aaaaa!
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
They were all out of 'em dude!
I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
Aaaaaaaa!
That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 
Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
More pie, hon?
Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
Shut up, Cartman!
That is so-ho lame!  Oh man, I...
-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
Whoa!
Wow, she's pretty.
Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?
Yes, ma'am.
Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?
Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
Alrighty then, let's get started! 
She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Until you puked on her.
Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! 
I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners 
Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?
Memememememe, me!
Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.  Cartman?
What's a multiplication table?
Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?  Well, where did he leave off?
We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- 
Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?
Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
Fine, Chef.  Just let me do my job before I get fired.
Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.
Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Stop kissing ass, Cartman!
I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! 
Where's your present, Cartman?
Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home 
Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now.  But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner. 
Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!
Nuh-uh!
Oh cool.
Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!! 
Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. 
Hello there, children.
Oh, hi, Chef.
Hey, yeah!
You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.
I am, too!
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
I woke up very early one Sunday morn...
This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
Hi guys, what's up?
Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. 
Wow! 
Dang! That's nice!
Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
Oh, weak, dude!
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Did you make love?
I think so.
No way!
Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!
That's not what we just heard!
Down! Down! Everybody down!
What the hell...? 
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month.
Boooriing. 
Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...
Oh! Oh I think I found one! 
No, I found it.
Oh. I do believe I found it first.
No, I did, Pip.
Oh dear.
Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.
What do you mean?
Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.
Okay, ready? I'll go first. 
Well-uh I, I guess you win.
Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 
That was cool!
Eeyy! Give me that back!
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
We'll roshambo for it!
No way, fatty, it's mine!
ANTHROPOLOGIST!
How's it going, boys?
I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
Hm, let me see that.  Why, this is Anasazi writing! My God, this must be thousands of years old!
Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
You liar, Cartman!
Screw you, triangle thief!
Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby.
Eeyy!
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
You did throw it away, Cartman.
I was just setting it aside.
Well, you might as well let it go.
Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
What would we use a marble sack for?
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
I didn't steal anything.
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
Good! 
What's that noise? 
Whoa!
Aaah! Aliens! 
Yyeeaahh.
No! I found it, he stole it!
You threw it away, Cartman!
I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.
Problemo? Huh, There's no problemo, Officer. I was just introducing myself to these charming little boys.
Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!
Cartman?
You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
Cookeh monter
Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
Huh?!
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.I got the triangle, I got the triangle, dee dun dee dun
Man, the bus sure is late.
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.
Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours.
Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!
But I'll die.
Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...
I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.
It is?
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-
ENOUGH!!  Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - moneyy - for the triangle.
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! 
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
No, not when money is involved, stupid! 
Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever!
Ugh. Llet me go! Seriously!
You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with my triangle! 
Eey!  It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.
Wheeere is the triangle of Zinthar?!
I don't remember.
Maybe this will help jar your memory...
No! Don't!  AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!
NOOOW do you remember?!
WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!
Happiness with you is like happiness... 
Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe. 
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
Oh no! No! She has joned the two triangles?
Yes! She stole my triangle!
It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her! 
Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
Sweet!
Can I have my walkie-talkie back now, please?
No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
Alright, I'll roshambo you for it. Ready?
Huh?  Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!
Good-bye, Robert Smith!
Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 
Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll roshambo you for it! 
Yeah.
Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!  Oh no! She's back!
In the backyard?
Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you.
You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.  Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?
Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you.
Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. 
We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea.
Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
Oh, hell yes!
My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much.
That's niiice, Peter Panda.
I donnow, just keep rolling.
More tea, Rumpertumskin?
Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome.
Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Eeeyy!
Meow.
No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
Meow.
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!
How is your beefy roast, snookums?
Mom? Can I ask you a question?
Sure, hon.
You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
Uh huuuh.
And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
Yyeess??  Well, what's your question, hon?
God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
Oooooohh.
I want to know where I came from.
Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other.
Uh huuh.
And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha. 
So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?
Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Naive American.
Meow.
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
Naive American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. 
What?? 
Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!  Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
What are you talking about, Cartman?!
My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
He claims to be your kid.
Hiya, Dad!
Who the hell are you?
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Your mother?
Liane Cartman.
Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second.  Look, kid, I'm not your father.
But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'
Whatooya mean?
She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'
Huh??
Your mom's a slut 
Eeyy!!
Ahah, I'm plastered! 
His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
'S up, homies? 
Cartman?!
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.  You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad. 
Hello?
Yo, Pops!
Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?
You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
Get in here! 
Westsa-eed-eh.
Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!
You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
What?! Noh! Uh, did I?
He said you kissed her with your tongue.
Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
Huho. So you're not my dad?
Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, "Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...
What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!
Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend. 
I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all. 
Really? You don't think so?
Naw, you're not fat.
Gee, that's kewl. 
Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem!  Another Cosmo, please.
All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
What the hell are you talking about, Eric?
It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
I am not gay!
Then you did sleep with my mom?
Wait, wait.  I know a way to find out. 
How?
At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.
Really? You can? 
Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...
How much?
Three thousand should cover it.
I don't have $3000.
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Hi guys.
How's it going, Cartman?
Oh, fine. How are you guys?
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?
Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...  Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
You do?
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-
What kind of video did you guys make?
And now our second finalist, "Little Boy Has A Tea Party." 
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
Dammit!
I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously. 
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!
Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks.
What?!  Son of a bitch!
They look like groundhogs.
He's my father?! 
And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
Waait!  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
Goddammit! Who's my father?
We've got to get him to the hospital.
You've got to be kidding me!
Come on, children! 
Eeeehh..!
Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
Is he awake yet?
Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
They can't. Mephesto can't die.
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Really?
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
I'm sailing away
No! Don't!
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
Eh-- 
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
Yeah, stop being a wuss!
Well, this is about all I can do for him.
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
Sorry, son, it might be a while.
Wake up, you son of a bitch!
Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
Hey, Cartman.
What?
I'm sailing ay...
--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...
Oh, weak. 
...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--
Whoa, this is a good movie!
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee
Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.  Metaphorically speaking, that is.
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
Coming! 
Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
Sweet.
Suction! 
Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
That is really starting to piss me off.
We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.  Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.  Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here  where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.  Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?
Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
No, he'll die!
Go, Kenny!
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. 
I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--
Just tell us already!
Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--
Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.  The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
Ooohhh, forget it! 
Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
Reading sucks ass.
Wow, these books look cool!
Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading.
God, shut up, dude.
Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these. 
Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.  Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see...
Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?
Eric, why don't you go first?
Oooaaagh.
What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?
I'm prepared!  For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!
God-dammit! 
Hooray!
Goody two-shoes.
Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
Really? I wanna be a cop.
You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 
Do I get a nightstick?
Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.
10-4, sergeant! 
That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
Ey! 
Uhh, yes, Officer?
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
Step out of the car, please, sir.
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
Sir, step out of the car, please.
Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!
Get your ass to jail! 
Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
Sweet.
Five George is en route to 496 Broad Wasteland...
Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them. 
Hi there, little lady.
Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?
Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?
Sir, step out of the car, please.
What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?
Sir, step out of the car.
Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!
Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah. 
Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!
Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance. 
Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
We're fine, officer. 
And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
Poor people tend to live in clusters.
What—What did you say?
Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
Shut up, bitch!
Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
Mom hit Dad again! 
Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah! 
All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
Chickenlover!
Grab him! 
Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?! 
You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand.
Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
Cartman!
I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
A-ha! 
No, no, that's not how you uphold the law! 
Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!
You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
Ooohhhh.
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
Okay?
No, it's his bris.
What the hell is a "bris"?
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
Man! That sucked, getting searched. 
Yeah, my ass is killing me.
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
I wonder who took it.
No.
I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Wo-what's that?
Ahhh, bicycles?
Ham?
No, not ham, you fat fuck!
Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
That's right.
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
A "fireman"?
That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
What the hell is gahekgafuga?
Meaning we're going to circumcise him. 
They are gonna cut off his fireman!
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
There, what do you think?
What the hell is that supposed to be?
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Is that why it stinks so bad? 
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
Eech.  Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
Fireman!
Ohhh, thanks.
Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. 
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. 
Naturally.
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life... 
Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
M'kay.
Okay?
Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.
What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
Oh-- Noooo!
Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
Eewwww!
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".
Who the hell cares what it's called, as long as she doesn't have to touch me.
AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!
Heyh! They have a zoo there!
I'd love to!
Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go! 
I caught it, I caught it!
You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.
Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap. 
Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll! 
You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? 
Dude, what does that mean?
I dunno.
I have no idea, dude.
Come on, rice picker!
Ohhh.
Oooh, I get it.
Dude, it's the freak nurse!
Holy crap!
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)
Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?
Awww..!
Son of a bitch.
Oh. Yeah, we sure were.
Was it fun?
Wow!
Man, Vietnam was sweet!
Aawwww!
Sweet.
Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.
You're dead, Stan.
You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?
Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!
We've got to get him back, dude.
Totally.
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!
Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
Lying kicks ass!
Okay. Action! 
Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
Cut! Cartman!
What?
It's supposed to be a frog!
I know that!
Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
It's a Sri Lanka frog!
Der, Cartman!
Der yourself, hippie!
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! 
Action!
Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
Ee-goddammit!
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
They better not!
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
Scared of a plastic frog?
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
Man, this is stupid.
Good. A-and action! 
Eee-ee-ee-ee! 
Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
Dude, totally.
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
Revenge is so very, very sweet.
And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
Dibs!
You big piece of crap!
That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie! 
Bring it on, you bitch! 
Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
You bastards!
Ey, you guys! 
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.
I sent her away.
Sent her away where?
Hey, Cartman!
What?
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Hmmm, let me see. No!
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
I know, but, it's really snowy today.
Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. 
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
Aaaah- 
All done!
Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual. 
Ms. Crabtree?
Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
What?
I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck!
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
Oh, man, this sucks.
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Ow!
Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Come on Cartman, fart!
I don't wanna.
Fart, damn you!
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! 
Whoa, look at that.
It's completely immature! 
Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
You guys can't scare me!
You can say that again.
Was that how it happened?
Nope.
God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
What do you think it is?
The lava's comin' right for us!
Heellp! 
Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Dude! He's making ice cream. 
Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?
Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  Let's have ice cream, everyone! 
Beefcaake!
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
Oh, yeah.
Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee. 
I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? 
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
Hay, wait a minute.
What?
Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
Eeeeyyyy! 
You can do it, Fonzie.
You bastards!
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense. 
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
It does?
Me too, Marcus. I've forgotten all about my cares in the world.
Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
I hope my dad doesn't sing.
Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... John Elway. 
Sweeeeeett! 
Uh oh.
This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father! 
My father is John Elway, my father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.
Come on, son. I'll buy you some ice cream. 
Now, that's what I call a sti-
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts! 
Hooray!
Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-
Ah-are you okay, hon?
Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.
Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? 
Yes, please. 
Mmmm.
Mmmm.  Mmmm.
Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! 
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
Jesus, Cartman!
Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys! I'm going home. 
Man, it's hot out here.
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
Come on, Cartman, get on.
Stan?
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Ugh... Whatever. 
Right. 
Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come? 
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
It is not!
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
I am not swimming around in pee!
Whatever, dude.
My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
But Cartman, we're trying to--
Uh, screw you guys. Home. 
Uh, crap..!
Eh-eh-eh-eh... 
Okay kids, everyone in the pool!  Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now.
Nuh-uh.
Just jump in.
I don't wanna.
It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it. 
Egh-- 
There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us.
Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later.
Later's fine.
Just do your side stroke.
I only know how to do it doggie style.
That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!
Can I do it doggie style?
Okay.  That's it! That's it, you can do it!
Sweet..!  Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
Come on, Eric!
No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
Fine.
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
Yeah, they need to shut it off.
Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song! 
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Where is Chef?
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
Wow.
Thank you, that is all. 
Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.  Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it. 
Hooray! 
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.  I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
The snake's been destroyed.  The pool's open!
Huh?  Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..! 
Hey, Chef!
How's it going? 
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!
I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!
...bitch.
That's it Eric, you-!
I'm going! 
Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.
I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!
What kind of cookies?
They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems" 
I wanna Fudge 'Em.
Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"
Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
Yeah, pretty much.
Yeah!
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
Ay!
Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. 
Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.
(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 
Well?
I'm gonna, just give me a minute.
Hey, dude, these are good!
Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef. 
Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...
Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
What was that? 
Aw, man, let's get out of here!
Oh uh- hello, children.
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
Good. See you in school. 
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home. 
Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht.
Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh.
Yes.
No. 
Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
Oh my God.
Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?
Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
All of us?
Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?
Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey.
I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.
We have contracts.  You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work.
Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!
Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
You're daaamn right.
Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95! 
I'd like to pay for one.
Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
I don't know.
Whoa!
Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
Yes. And I've learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
Oh weak!
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto
Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner. 
And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto
Sshh! Cartman!
What?
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
Where is the Nintendo?
Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
Oh, good. I'm starving.
Amen.
Pfff..!
That one's mine, that one's mine!
What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
Puh! I heard that.
Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.
Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.
(Waa-choo!)
Ey! 
Cartman, what the hell is that?
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
(Uh-huh.)
Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
Don't scratch it, hon.
But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!
No, hon.
Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!
Here, I got you some calamine lotion. 
I don't wanna.
It'll make your itches go away. 
Ugh. Uunnh.  Ey, give me that!  Ahhhh...
Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
More calamine lotion!
Practice makes perfect, bubbe.
Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 
Oh, no.  Damnit!  No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!  Uh. Yes. Uh...
I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 
It's about friggin' time! Give me that! 
Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
Uugh!  Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh... 
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."  Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool." 
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
She what?!
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
Huh?
We want you to give our parents herpes.
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
Hell no, you guys get your own!
It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 
Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
Ooh, I have them somewhere else, boopiekins.
Hooray!
Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 
Well, I know one thing for sure.
What's that, Eric?
We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
AAWWWW!
Planetariums suck!
Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country.
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer? 
Hey, there it is!
We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!
Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! 
But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.  Yes, little boy?
How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?
Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works.
As if we care.
Here we see the constellation called, "The Big Dipper". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it,  a-hah , we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull , while these stars form the constellation, "Roger Ebert" . And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades . Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of...
Aw man, screw this. 
That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner.
Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
Oh, and what's your name, little boy?
Eric Cartman.
Aaah! 
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!
Wow!
Thaat's right, suck on that. 
Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
I did it! I did it!
Did what?
I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
Yeah, mine too.
Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.
Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
Hey, be careful, asshole!
Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. 
Eric, where have you been?
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
Where have you been, Cartman?
Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship! 
Whoa!
This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
Very good, Kyle.
Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it! 
Don't pick your nose, hon.
I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while.
Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs! 
Psych!
Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
I know, I know! 
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
Well, Heric Cartman, that certainly was... insane.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Don't pick your nose, hon.
I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch! 
Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman.
Yes! I'm the best!
That's odd.
Sweeet!
Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
I'm over here. 
Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.
Aay!  Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
Okay, roll camera, aaand action.
I love Cheesy Poofs, you-
Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.
Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake! 
Aaand action.
I love Cheesy Poofs-
Sure thing. 
Oh, man, c'mon!
Okay. Here we go, aaand action.
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-
Cut!
What?!
I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
Oh, God damnit!
Hello?
Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you.
I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-
Okay, bye. 
Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch. 
Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message.
Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
Oh, dude, here it comes!
And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
Well, let's begin, shall we?  And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known! 
Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!  Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!  You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!  Planetariums suck ass! 
Cartman! You saved us! 
What the hell are you talking about?
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero. 
Don't pick your nose, hon.
God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
Yeah! You're dead!
I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
No, you don't!
--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! 
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
What are you guys doing?
We're building a clubhouse.
A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
Wwwhy??
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
Fine!
Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
Fine!
Fine!
Fine!
Fine! That's fine. 
Fine!
Fine!
(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 
Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
(Uh--)
No, Kenny.
How's the treehouse coming along, hon?
Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
Sorry, hon.
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!
Well, all right.
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
(You suck ass and you suck dick!) 
And stop your bitchin'!
That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
Better than yours, fat boy.
We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.
But I didn't write the note!
Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
Mmkay.
Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!
(Uh huh)
And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
(Yeah!)
All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha.
What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?  Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.
Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
Oh well, I guess it beats living at home.
Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? 
Hello?
How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
We're working on it.
Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
No, you don't!  Dude!
It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, "Make sure you're home before midnight!"
Ahaw, that's weak.
And I go, "Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"
That's killer.
And she goes, "Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"
That's totally weak!
So I go, "Fine! I won't come home!"
Sweet.
And then she goes, "Fine! Don't come home!", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.
Killer weak, sweet!
I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.  I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!" 
Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
Coming, Mom.  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!
Oh hey, Scott.
Who the hell are you?!
Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
How many people?
Hey, kid, give me some of those! 
Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
What? That game's for kids.
This is bullcrap! 
Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! 
(Huh?) 
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves. 
Wwow!
Dude, that kicks ass!
Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
Five dollars for three balls.
Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth. 
That's easy!
Okay, we've got a player!
Ay! Check it out!  Damn it!
Okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! 
You suck, Cartman!
I'd like to see you do better!
Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
I only have three dollars left, asshole!
Okay, here! 
Sweet.
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
I only need one, dude. I only need one.
Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
How much is it?
Sure. It's veery scary.
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.
You'd better be right, dude.
I'm right!
So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS! 
Eh! God-damnit! 
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
Yeah, this line is way too long!
I think we're almost to the end.
Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride? 
How much?
Just three dollars.
Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. 
You dumbass, Cartman!
What? This is cool.
No, it's not cool!
It is, too! 
How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
Aah, three dollars.
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
Ey! Seriously!
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Well, I'm sorry!
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! 
You said Buttbaby. 
Sweet.
Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
O-kay, I'll- get on the bull.
He really wants those dolls.
I guess, damn!
Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
Hey, this is sweet.
You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!
Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
You guys, eh seriously, my back!
Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
Seriously. Help.  Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
What'd you say, Cartman??
I hate you guys!
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
Hate you guys.
Okay, Cartman. You ready?
Nnoo.
Open the gate! 
All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Yeah, this is sweet!
Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 
Eeyy!
Hold on, Cartman!
Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f-

Aaah! Ten dollar!  Ten dollar, soldier boy!

Ten dollar? Sucky-sucky?
Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
What are you guys doing?
Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
Really? What about?
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
Oh-h. Nowhere. 
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again. 
Oh! Son of a bitch!
What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head.Stinky britches, you got stinky britches
Hello, children. Ready for lunch?
Stinky britches, you got stinky, stinky--
Eric, is there a problem?
Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.
"Stinky Britches" by Alanis Morissette?
Yeah. Stinky, stinky britches
Yeah.
Stinky britches, you got stinky--
Hey, Chef.
You got stinky britches, stinky--
Eric, where did you hear that song?
It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.
You wrote it?
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
Yeah, and he’s Jewish.
And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the…day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous Chewbacca defense?
What's a Chewbacca defense?
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
O-kay, then.
Wow, he’s good.
Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--
Sure. Just please stop.
See? I told you guys it would work.
Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
What's that?
Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
No, it isn't, you guys. 
Can I help you?
We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies…
I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan.
What?!
Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums.
Three Crispy Yum Yums.
Yeah. What the hell do you want?
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
He’s not dying, Cartman!
Shut your goddamn mouth.  We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--
Cartman?
Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated here.
No more Chef.
No more Salisbury steak and… pecan pie. 
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Four.
Hey, that's a great idea!
Yeah!
What? Jail?
I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
Would you like sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut, Fräulein Setski 
Then, let’s rock and roll! Or something similar.
Hooray!
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
Ha-ha, you're a wuss. 
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Hey guys. How's it going? 
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
What?
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed.  I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too? 
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
Why do you keep saying "hella," fatass?!
'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
That's not cool!
You guys are just hella jealous.
Who the hell could that be? 
Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. 
(Uh huh!)
Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!
(It's the only thing I could afford.)
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
I haven't been sleeping so well.
God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! 
I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 
Hoh, that sucks, dude.
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
Cartman?
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
What are you doing?!
What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
You can't be standing there, Cartman.
Why the hell not?!
Because you're standing over there! 
Aaah! Son of a bitch!
Wow, you don't see this every day.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Dude, this is hella weird.
Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!
...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!
Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
Cartman!
Dude, this is hella cool.
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
I'll help you, Stan.
Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
Can do!
Screw you! 
I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. 
Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! 
Meow.
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!
Meow.
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. 
NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!!  Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
Aaaaagh!
Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. 
Aha! There you are, Cartman!
P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?
What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum.  I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!
Don't touch me! 
Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
Yes!
Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. 
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
Noooooo! 
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
What?!
He is!
Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
What?!
It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world.
Noooo! Screw you guys! 
How did you guys know?
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
You tricked us, Cartman!
That's right, I did!You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella!
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
Okay, let's go!
Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
See you in a couple of days, son.
Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun!  Kenny, I called it shotgun!  Dammit, Kenny, get in the back!  Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there.  Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade!  Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! , Go get it!  ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. 
Yeah. Or, we could not.
Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
Over the meadow and through the woods,
To Grandmother's house we go
Argh!
Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy.
I guess, damn! 
Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--
We don't care, Mom.
I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
Cool!
How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
About another hour, hon.
Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow...
Over the meadow and through the woods...
Jesus Christ, finally!
Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma! 
Oh, it's little Eric!
Hi, Grandpa!
Hi, Eric. Grandma got you a present.
Sweet. What is it?
It's inside.
Yes! Move it! 
He's not fat, he's big-boned.
I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.
Sick, dude.
Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?
Here you go, Eric. Hap-py Holidays! 
Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! 
Yes. I thought that would look really good on you.
Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
What?!
I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!
Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?
Hi, cousin Elvin.
Dude, is he here every year like this?
Yup!
God-damn it, why the hell do I always have to say grace? If one more person asks me to say grace, I'll be like, "Eh! I'm not saying grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square  in the nuts!"
Amen. 
No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie!  No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!
Bad Jimmy!
I heard it, too.
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was that for!
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
Ow!
I wanted to make sure, too.
Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!
Dude, it's coming through the window! 
Uncle Howard!
Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here.
Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!
Yeah, well I'b I busted out. 
Wow, cool!
Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
Okay.
If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.
Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
What?
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
All right, keeps your pants on.
Hey, bring us down some food, all right?
Okay. 
Come on, Team!
Can somebody drive us to the mall?
Yeah!
Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
And these Cornhuskers have the ball on the 50-yard line!
Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?
Not now, Eric.  Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?!
Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!
I said "no," and I mean "no!" Respect my authorituh!
Damn his Goddamned authorituh!
Eric, I need you to take care of your cousin Elvin for a while.
I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
Won't yo do it for Grandma?
All right. Give me $10. 
Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!
My family sucks ass!
All families suck ass!
Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. 
What's the matter?
My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. 
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. 
Mr. Hankey kicks ass!
And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
So?!
So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
I really like that guy.
Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin.  God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin!  No, Elvin, bad Elvin! 
Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again. 
I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone.  Look!
Oh, uh that's pretty cool.
Run for your lives, boys! 
Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. 
Keep your heads down, kids! 
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Alrighty, then. 
Lock the door! 
I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help.
See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.
What was that?  What the?! 
Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson! 
"Hark," the herald angels sin,
"Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled"
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
"Hark," the herald angels sing
Yeah, we don't care.
Yeah, that's fine.
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 
Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
But we'll starve and die like dogs.
Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
(Fuck you!)
Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
(Look at me! Look at me!)
You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
Killer!! 
Ey, let me have some grounds. 
Eugh.
No...more...coffee. Blech. 
"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
What will become of the endeavoring American family?"
Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening.
Neither did we.
Come on, boys! Let's go!
Aw, man, this sucks! 
Uh...
This guy sucks ass!
I like small businesses.
I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
What now?
So what are we gonna say?
Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
Waagh!
I think my mom is a corporation.
What the hell? 
Well, I'll be damned.
Hey there, little guy.
Bad! 
Cartman!
What?!
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. 
Is that all you've got, pussy?
What?! 
Hey, he talks!
Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!
You're a pussy, pussy!
Ey!
O-kay. Follow me. 
Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.
Not much longer now.
Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?
No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village.
Oh, your pussy village?
Follow me.
I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
No it isn't, you guys!
This is where all our work is done.
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
You see,Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit.
Oh, I get it.
Just kidding, son. 
I love you guys. 
(He actually killed it!)
I told you guys.
Yeah! 
There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
Get away from me, Cartman! 
Come 'ere, crocky.
(You bastard!)
Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. 
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! 
I think so. Is Cartman up there?
I'm right here, Kyle.
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
Screw you, hippie!
He's like, some frozen guy.
Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!
You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
Help me chip some of the ice away.
Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning."  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
Cartman, will you shut the hell up and get some more rope?!
Aww, screw you guys anyway!
Hooray!
For what?
(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)
I think we're almost there, you guys.
We came for our reward.
Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
No, I'll go! I found him!
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Sweet.
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
Killer.
Fine! 
Fine.
Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.
I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.  Eight and thirteen? 
Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch! 
You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
You son of a bitch cat!
Come on! 
Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. 
Was the ice man here?
He might have been, by crikey.
Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
Wow! Kick ass!
Wait a second.  I think he came through here recently.
Yeah, I think the same thing.
Calm down, calm down.
Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
Yes, hello. I see you.
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.
Me, too. He sucks.
Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha! There's a king croc right there!  And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-
Moo! 
Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
Eric Cartman, you say "excuse me"!
Okay.
So, who wants to join the fun??
What if you don't have any rhythm?
Excuse me?
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.
Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 
And that's exactly why you need to go!
Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?
Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.
Whoopee.
And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
Yeah, pretty much.
Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.
The nightmare begins.
Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting!
Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.
Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
Eric, sit down!
Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
Your family isn't poor? 
Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?
Okay.  Kugheek! 
Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-
Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.
All right, that does it!  Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!
I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-
I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?
Why?
Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
Eh-heheh!
Thanks!
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.
Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.
Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? 
Bad! Bad monkey! 
Eric, what the heck are you doing?? 
I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, "Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!" and I smack him on the head!
And here is a three-toed sloth. 
It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!
Respect my authoritah!
The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!
Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
What's the matter, little boy?
He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 
Oh my God!! 
Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children.
Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! 
¿Qué?
Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
Y taco.
I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job!  Aaaah!
This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
Eric, where are you going?
I'm going this way!
Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!
Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 
Young man, I have had it!!
Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.
Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard!  Eric, we have to stay together!
God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 
No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
What are you doing here, little boy?
I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?
Food! I have to have food! 
Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!
Chicken wings. 
Chicken wings!
Medium spicy. 
Eric?
Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
(Yeah, you guys. Seriously.)
Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
You bastards!
What the hell happened to him?
This is gonna be fun.
I'm gonna be Jesus!
You're too fat to be Jesus!
Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
Stan should be Jesus.
Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
You're such a fat baby!
Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
Die! 
Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
Peter!
I don't know you, dude.
Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
Hi, mom. 
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
Up your ass with broken glass!
Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.
Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
Yeah, me too.
Well, get me down from here!
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
What?!
Then I can give it to my dad. 
Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
Hey, there you guys are!
Cartman??
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
...Really?
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.
Yeah.
You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
Officer Barbrady! 
T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...
Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
Dude, he's still not dead.
You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
She's not worried about you.
Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
That's not your mom calling!
Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
Hey, yeah! 
Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stand and Kyle" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...
Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 
Hey you guys. Seriously. 
What the-?  Oh, what now?!
Chef! Chef!
Children, what the hell are you doin'?
Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!
Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.
What?
It's really gonna piss you off.
What?!
This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
Oh, damnit!
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
Hello-o.
That's amazing!
Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
Get me down from here!
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
You're not fat, you're big-boned.
That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
Eric Cartman. 
Weak. 
Hello, Eric.
Hi, Doctor Lout.
How's my little piggy today?
Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
I just say that because you're my little buddy.
I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now!
God damn it!
Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
Yes.
All right, read them out for me.
I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!
No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence.  I do not know how that happened.  "I am a little piggy." Wow! What are the odds of that?  All right, let's get down to business, shall we? 
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?
They look exactly the same.
Just pick one. Or two.
I don't know, two!
Okay. One, or two? One, or two?
Uh, one.
One, or two? One, or two?
Two.
No! The answer is one, piggy! One! 
Ow! I hate you!
Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.
Hey dudes.
Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? 
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
Why?
Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
Hey, yeah!  Ow!
Hello there, children.
Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
Shut up, Cartman!
Ow!
What's the problem?
My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
...Yeah, screw that bitch.
Bitch, I hate that bitch!
All right, we got the test results back, piggy-
Stop calling me piggy!
You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
So, what does that mean?
It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. 
Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
That's why we have the little stapler. 
Ow! Son of a bitch!
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
Dude! Just take them off!
I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?
Uh, yeah, sure sure.
Wow! You really got fat.
Ey!
No way, dude!
Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
Hello, children!
Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
Oh, no!
Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
Now, hon.
But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right? 
Hey! You son of a bitch!
All right. Time to laser me a little piggy. 
Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.
Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 
Okay. 
Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie.
Aaah! It's the succubus! 
Jesus dude! 
What? What happened?
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...
He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
What what what?
God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Okay. 
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
Ow! 
-the to on- 
Oh no! The tape jammed! 
Come on Cartman!
I can't see anything!
Oh my-
Got it! 
Hooray! 
What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?
After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Was he an organ donor?
Eh-sure.
Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.
Ooooohh.
Arrrrh!
Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
Yes, you did!
Told ya!
(Woohooo!) 
I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 
Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Do you wanna bet?
Yeah, I'll bet.
How much?
Five bucks.
Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
He did?
Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
Why would he say that?
I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
Well, I've gotta go over there and-
No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
We'll see!
Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
You're on, fatass! 
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
Aw, hell!
Those sons of bitches!
Okay.
Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
Red Racer's on.
Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
Nope. 
Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
After Red Racer.
After Red Racer, of course.
I uh...
However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
Shut up, fatass!!
Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! 
Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. 
When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
Well?
Come on!
Huh?
What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
Aw, dude, come on!!
You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Fine! 
Fine!
Fine, that's fine!
The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. 
Let us begin.  Ready? And, th-ree.
Respect my authoritah! 
Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. 
I win!
There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.
Hey, maybe. 
Rrrr, mean, rrrr.
The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
Okay.
Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
Come on, Tweek!
Come on, Craig!
Ye-hah!
Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
Come on, Craig!
Well, why the hell don't you stop them?
'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
What was on the news?
Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
Where are you going?
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
Just go behind a tree.
I have to go number two.
So? You can poo in the wilderness.
No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
Well what do I sit on?
Not here! Go further away!
God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
Watch out for ground eels! 
Stop, you guys! I can't think!
What do you have to think about?
I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.
Sick, dude!
Poopin' outside,
Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?
(Here you go.)  (No way!) 
What the?
Oohma poota!
Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!
You guys, get over here!
No way, dude!
I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes.
I see it!
Come on! Let's kill it! 
Over here!
Come on, you guys!
Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.
Well, let's kill it.
No! No. Don't.
Huh?
I like it.
Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
Wow! Cool!
It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
I'll think about it, hon.
Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door.
Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.
Should I get it?
Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.
Okay.
Hmmm. 
Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!
Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh.  Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick.
You mean the other jakovasaur?
What means a jakovasaur?
You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
Oh. Cool beans.
But the other jakovasaur talked different.
That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. 
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke!
Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. 
Wow!
Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
Huhello, guys. I love new friends. 
Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?
What are we supposed to do with him?
We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
Why don't we just tell our parents?
No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
I am whispering!  Yyeow!
Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.
Thank you, Mayor.  The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back.
"Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
What are you doing, fatass?!
I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!
Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
Yeah. 
You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters.
Aren't they cute, you guys?
Dude, this sucks ass!
I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. 
Hooray! 
Hey, Jakov, how's it going?
Great, Eric! We're moving.
Moving?
Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis.
You... can't leave. You're my friend.
Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!
Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.
It would?
Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?
O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!
Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! 
You can't leave.
Yes. Who would take care of them?
Little boy, we're making you an honorary Department of Interior person.  So now, you are officially in charge of South Park's fish and wildlife. You have authority over all of them.
I have authoriteh?
That's right. And people must respect it.
Well, that should be fine, just fine. 
Fine, just fine.
Fine.
You're a nut! Let me see that letter.  It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete. 
Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?
Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-
Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. 
Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!
What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
That's Kenny with branches on his head.  Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys?
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 
Werrr. 
Jakov!
Close the door! 
Open this door!
Eric, this is for the best.
I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah!  No! Jakov, don't go!
Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then! 
Come... back. 
Eric, it's important for you to understand-.
Don't, mother! Just, don't.
Hooray!
No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. 
Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric?
When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
Ohh, dude, get me out of here!
I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
You would think that, you little ass-sucker.
What did you call me?
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
What?
You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
No you can't, you little ass-sucker!
Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!
This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?
Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.
Th... That is correct, my honor.
Hoh, whatever! 
He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
I called you an ass-sucker!
Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. 
All right, we did it!
Hooray!
I have to give him half my stuff?
Sweet..!
Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.
Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
Uh, no! I hate that toy!
Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! 
Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.
What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
Interesting.  Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. 
All right! We did it, Eric!
It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah
You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!
Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school.
No way!
I won!
This is ridiculous!
Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!
Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut.
Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
Noooo! 
Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go.
What?!
Dude, what the hell is going in?!
Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?
Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots.
Where's that?
Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the "Run Around With Scissors" Pig.
I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
Okay, sorry, sorry.
You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.
Oh, save me! Who will save me?
I will! James West, cowboy and rap star!  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
If we save her, I am going to take off her pants and play Slip'N'Slide!
Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
You cannot stop me, James West!

But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West.
I have to leave soon, Eric.
But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
Come down as soon as you're done. 
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's

Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! 
Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?
Uh-huh.
Be good.
Right.
Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! 
Aw, Ma.

Jesus Christ. 
Bye, kids. 
Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!  Ow!
Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? 
My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!
You're not allowed to have people over!
Move! 
This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!
Figure it out, turd!
God damnit!  Shut up, Kitty!  Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha!  I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! 
...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-
Damnit! 
...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-
Ey! I need to use the phone!
Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. 
Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! 
I placed his underwear over his head.
I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!!  SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! 
They mostly come at night, mostly.
They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
Hey there, is Shelly around?
Who the hell are you?
Hey, Skyler.
You know this guy?
He's my boyfriend! 
Christ, he's like 50 years old!
He's 22! 
Dude, that's not cool.
Ye Yeah-ha.
Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit!
Mmmmm 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Mmmmm 
I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
Turd Rock From the Sun!
Ey! You ate all the pizza!
We left you some crusts! 
That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! 
Guess again, Richard the Turd!
Give me that phone number!
Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. 
I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
Meow.
God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. 
Meow.
Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. 
What the-?
Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!
Give me that picture!
Aaaaa!  Yes!
Open this door, Turdledove!
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
Give me that picture, turd!
You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
I'm gonna bust this door down! 
What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 
We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
Meow. Meow. 
Oh! God damnit!
Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. 
Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
You just want me to open the door!
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
What?? Ih- is she okay?
Not really. She's dead.
Huh?! 
Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
You mean this one? 
O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! 
Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. 
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly.
Aw, man, you guys suck.
Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.
You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!
Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!
Ey, shut up, tubby!
Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh!  You get out now and respect my authoritah!  Ow! 
Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!
Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
Well, there's a whole crappy band here!  Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? 
This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
Damnit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
Mhm, mkay? 
I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
Meowr!  Meowuh!  Oh meah!
Testing, testing, 1 2.  Sweet. 
We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
Okay. See you in a while.
Wha-?
Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
What?! No you don't!
No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.
Yuh, you mean it?
But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
Shut up, turd!
That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
What are you doing?
I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
Go away, turd!
I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!
If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there!  Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!
Gotcha! 
I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
You're not ugly.
You don't think so?
Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
Huh?
If you want, I could help you.
Really? You would do that?
Just let me get my cowboy hat.
Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot. 
Okay, it's clear. 
Over here! Please, come quick! 
We don't have much time!
This won't take me long!
Hurry up in there!
Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God damnit!  Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night!  My guitar! NOOOOO!
That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. 
Oh my God! 
They're having a cat orgy!
You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on.  That's it. Come on, come on.  Uh oh.
Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
Yeah. I think we get along okay.
Hi, kids. I'm home.
Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
Wow, she passed out.
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 
Reowr.
No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
Reowr.
No, Kitty! 
Roar?
No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?
Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.
Hooray! 
Hey kids!  Do you love Chinpokomon?
Yes.
Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!

Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it.

(No!)
C'mon. Give me Pengin!
(No! This is mine!)

Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
(Fuck you!)
God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
Huh?
You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.
No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
No, dude!
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
It's all Chinpokomon now.
What's the Primary Main Objective?
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
Ogh..!
Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
What?
Duhhh!
Yeah, get with the times, dude.

The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
Like, eight days ago.
Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
Get outta the way! Move it!
Yesuh. Anda what is the Evil Power?  The Evil Power is the United States gorvernment! 
Ohhh.
Welcome to campu. Whoever passes it knows and honors that the greatness of Japan is in its history, and it is based on that history that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!
Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. 
Damnit, this is not Japan!!
Minata! Kite kite, churi... 
Wild Wacky Action Bike comes with everything you see here. 
...Gay.
Not all people from Alabama are wife-beaters. 
Gay.
Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
No.  Screw this, dude. 
Where are you going, Stan?
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. 
What?
Yeah, dude, that's way over. 
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- 
What the..? 
Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! 
Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. 
Oh, dude, this is not cool!
Relax, fatass.
No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
What??
Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
Ow, dude! 
Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! 
Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.
Whoa, cool.
Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
Totally!
Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? 
Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
Oh. We don't know him.
We already know you know him. We have this!  Now, who is he?! 
Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? 
Who is this person!
K-kill me.
Aaaaaaaa!
No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
Adopted from whom?
Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
God job, fatass!
Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? 
Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others.
Oh, my God, this guy again. 
Whoa! 
Oh! Aww!  Oh, weak! 
He did take a ship.
Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
This is great!
Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 
Blubedegub? 
No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? 
Cool!
Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!
Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! 
Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?
No, never. It's perfect.
Get 'em! 
Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
Kenny!
Forget him! He's done for! 
(You guys, just fly away!)
No, no, he's done for. Come on! 
Which button did you press, Cartman??
U-u-huh. I don't remember.
You dumbass, Cartman!
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. 
I have the infidels in my sight. 
Holy shit!
Ho ho ho ho.
It's Sally Struthers!
Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
Wo?
Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. 
Dama doko nou na oh. 
Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. 
Oh, foada! 
She bought it.
Now's our chance!
Wait. I remember. It was the red button! 
Alright!
Alright,
Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
Dude!
What? We're not gonna come visit him.
I know, but you don't tell him that!
T'heh, whatever. 
Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids.
Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?
Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
Christmas?
—Christmastime is presents for me.
Awwww! 
Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys. 
Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
Welcome to Spooky Laboratory.  I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab. 
Cool!
Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.
Ewww-hoohooo.
And here you can feel the brains.
Oh-HO, grohoss.
And here you can feel the warm innards of the body 
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha!  Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa! 
You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. 
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
Aaaaah! 
Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...
Eric, your little friends are here.
Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
E-heric, it's only Halloween.
That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
Come on, fatass, we have to go!
Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.
I'm sorry, hon,
I can't go with you guys right now.
Yes you can, porky. 
Mom, seriously! 
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
God-damnit, mom!
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
How?
What's the scariest thing we could get?
Spooky spider?
Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
Are you insane?!
U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
This is gonna be fun!
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
"Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!"  Ow.
Yes you do! Now, dig! 
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...
Aaaah!
Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
Heh heh, I'm sweet.
Okay, grab the sled. 
Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
Cartman?!
It wasn't me! 
(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!
Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!
Sign heah, and heah, and heah. 
I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! 
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
Where's your costume, fatass?
Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!" 
(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
Uuh, problem, guys.
What's the problem?
Nno Grandma.
No Grandma??
Nno Grandma.
What does this dead grandma look like?
Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
Good idea.
How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.
Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.  When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.
Wow, cool!
Alright! Great job, gang! 
That didn't help at all.
Sweet! 
Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! 
Eric, Mommy got you a present!
A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.
This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics."

Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! 
What?! 
Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."
What?! What the fuck that that mean?
"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
Holy crap! 
Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. 
Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum!  Come on! 
Eric, your word is "chair."
Uuh. Definition?
Something you sit on.
Country of origin?
English! 
Could you please use it in a sentence?
Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!
Uh- chair. C H A R E  God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?!  Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!
Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.
Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. 
It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
Oh, yes. We must do it again.
No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.
How come you don't go to school?
My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
Right.
Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?
Shut up, Cartman?
You shut up,  butthole.
You shut up,  gaywad!
You shut up,  ass-logger!
Hey, guys. What's up?
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark?
Ey! How come you never pick me?!
The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.
Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff.
That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! 
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
Eeehhh.
Welcome to Huntin' and Killin' with Jimbo and Ned.
Eehh, shut up.  Ooohhh, yeasss.
Hon, are you ready for some math problems?
Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
Oh, all right. 
Mom?
Yes?
Could you turn up the heat just a little?
Sure, hon. 
Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules.  Yeeehhhhhhss! 
Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. 
Ahhhhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.
Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.
Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. 
Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. 
Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
(Hey!)  (Hey, Cartman, help me.)
No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! 
Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!
You're damn straight, he did.
Thanks, gaywad. 
Now you're gettin' it.
Ready? 1-2-3-4. 
Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
I'm playing the drum.
Well, you have to hit it softer!
You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
Ey, I'll get it!
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
Yes I will!
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
Cartman!!! 
What?
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
No way! Flutes are totally gay!
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
You dick!
Later.
Dude, that's not cool.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
No they're not, stupid!
Yes we are!
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Right.
You're on!
Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 
Hey! What's that guy doing?!
Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
Hooray for the South!
Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
But why? Why should they get the bell?
Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.
But we don't have to lose.
What??
Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, "We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, "Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!" 
Run for your life, dude! 
God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
Aw, come on. Have a little sip. 
So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
You're dreaming!
Perhaps we should take Topeka.
Huh?
They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
They don't?!
No. I say we take Topeka.
I'll bet we could, too! 
I'll bet you can't.
What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
Yeah! 
Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
Excuse meh.
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
Where to next, General?
Where did the Confederates go, son?
Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
Where are you going?
We're goin' home kid. Come on. 
We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
Haha! You lose, fatass!
God, I hate you guys!
Where are you going?
This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
Me neither.
Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
I got you. Oo-oh. 
Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
Woohoo!
Yes! Yes!
Yes.  Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you.  Uh...
Take the fort!
Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
Suck my ass!
What do we do, General? We're outnumbered.
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! 
I knew they would!
Yee-haw! All right!
Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists! 
Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
I don't. I made it up. 
Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?
What the hell are you guys doing?!
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
What?!
Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
No! We still have to fight!
Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.
NOOO!!
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
What??
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
Awwww!
Hahahaha haa ha!
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.
Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...

that's why they're lame.
What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
It's sooo amazing!  You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!
I'll try
Jews..
to make it spin.
...play stupid games.
It fell;
Jews...
I'll try again.
that's why they're lame.
I'll try
Jews...
to make it spin.
...play stupid games.
It fell;
Jews...
I'll try again.
that's why they're lame.
Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.
Yes, we know, Ms. Broflovski. It's so very interesting.
Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
You'll know our people always win.
Keep spinning:
Learn
Jews...
to make the dreidel spin 
...play stupid games.
You'll know 
Jews...
our people always win.
that's why they're lame. 
Courtney Cox,
Jews...
I love you.
...play stupid games.
You're so hot
Jews…
on that show.
that's why they're lame.
Courtney Cox,
Jews...
I love you.

that's why they're lame.
Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
And...
''O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
Fall (Fall) 
On your knees (On your knees) 
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
Divine (Divine)
The night
When I get presents (O-o)
O night (O o-night) 
Di-viiine! 
O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! 
Oh. Ah. Ch.
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now. 
Time to go, Mr. Hankey.
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
You guys! You guys!  Guess what?
What, fatass?!
I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 
No you didn't!
Yes! I really did.
How do you know?
Well, because yesterday I got my period. 
You got your what?
My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. 
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)
You did?
(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
Tampon? What's a tampon?
(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
Ew, doesn't that hurt?
You guys! I got my period, too!
Wow, cool!
Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
Awesome! We get powers?
Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 
He gives me hope when
I have only been bored
And he lifts me up with
His gentle arm...
Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
Here.
Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
(Dammit, here!)
And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
What's the matter, Kyle?
Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
My pleasure. I just love helping people.
Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
Hey assholes! 
Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.) 
Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
(Oh- ooowww!)
Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.
Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
Have I missed anything?
Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
No. I didn't, but-
Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 
Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?!  Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a-  "...of liberty." You're late!  "...my father-" What the hell was that?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
Shut up, fatass!
Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 
Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! 
That was pretty cool.
M'kay.
Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 
(Uh-uh.)
No? How about this? 
(Nope.)
Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
What's "lose bowel control?"
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
Nuh-uh!
How about this one, Kenny? 
There is no brown noise, fat boy!
That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! 
Stan, what's a queef?
Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!
Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!
Aaaa-
Damnit! 
Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
I told you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise."
Damnit Cartman, wha-?!
"An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does that mean?
No, uhno, not finkleroy.
How about geebo, or, or mung?
Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here.
Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
Yeah. They think they're so cool.
You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
You found what?
The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
I don't believe it!
Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 
That's amazing.
I told you guys!
Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Ooooh.
Yeah, dude!
They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
How do we write he note, Cartman?
Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 
Uh-oh. 
Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry.
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!
Sleds are for guys.
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
Yeah!
We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!
Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 
Fatass.
There! 
Oh! 
Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!
I'm sorry, Token.
Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad, Eric.
Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.
Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!
No way!
I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor.You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered  a hate crime.
...What the hell is a hate crime?
New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.
What? A federal offense?
Oh no.
Oh no??
Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of "Token?"
Uh, yes?
Who is Token?
He's a black kid that goes to my school?
Black!  Did you say black?! You called him black?!
He is black.
O! He said it again!  He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!
I did?
The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
No! I hate hippies!
What?!
I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This "monster" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!
Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one.
No!
Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? 
Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
(What the fuck for?!)
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
Calm down, Kenny!
(Hey!)
Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
(Yes)
Well, come on! I don't have much time! 
Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him  but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway.  Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about.
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit! 
Prisoner 24601, arriving.  Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500.  Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband.  At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! 
Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
Yeah!
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!
Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?
...Neither do we
Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?
Yeah!
Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
Here you go, boys. Keep it short.
Hey you guys.
Hey, fatass. How's prison?
Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
A what?
An ailnay ilefay.
Wwhat's that?
Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
...Yeah.
Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
Sshh! 
Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.
How are we supposed to give them to you?
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
Alright, here. 
Well, okay... here... l'see...
Me too.
Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. 
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. 
Well, did you get the cigarettes?
Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. 
Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  One.  Heh, two.  Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh  yeahhh. Hoh. Phew.  Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! 
You flushed them?!
Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.
Son of a bitch!
Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. 
Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!
Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game.  Ew, it smells, man.
Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!
But you said-
I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
I thought that-
Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess.  Hey. Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!
I want my Mo-omm 
Dude. 
Mommy, I want my Mommy! 
Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.
You will?
Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!
What's the matter?
It's my leg! I think it's broken.  You go on ahead without me.
Uhokay. 
Hey.  You're supposed to say, "I'm not going without you," or something.
Oh. Really?
Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.
Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. 
Okay. 
No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass!
Oh. I can't take these. 
Take them. They'll bring you luck.  Now go on. Get out of here. 
Romper?
Yeah?
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
Alright, freeze! 
You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
But you've been pardoned by the governor! 
O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 
Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-
You guys! 
Hooray!
That's right! I'm back! 
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.
What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
Uh-get set. Go! 
Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
Go, fatass!
When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
We're not gonna make it! 
Hey. 
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 
Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
Naah.
Sweet.
Eric!
Hey, Romper Stomper.
Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
You did? 
You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
Yeah. 
Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
Whoa! 
Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
Oh, yeah!
Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 
Oh, the monorail!
Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
What is it, snookums?
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
Yeah! This is so tits!
Don't say "tits," Eric.
Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!
He's fat and he's stupid?
Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 
For one tooth?
For one tooth.
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
...Totally what?
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.
Sega Dreamcast??
All we need is teeth.
(No way!)
Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
(No I don't! Thank you.)
Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.
(Woohoo!)
How are we gonna get it from him?
(Hey, guys!)  (Heey-ungh)  (Oowww.)
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
Hu-aah!
Higher, you guys.
Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 
What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!
I am the tooth fairy, my child.
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
Ey!
Come on, fatass!
Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
Well?
Bull's eye!
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
Okay.
Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
I know, huh?
Did the tooth fairy come?
Four dollars. 
(Oh, my God!)
Do you what this means?
What?
Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!
Yes, Eric
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy." I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
No, honey. It's just-
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
Eric! Eric, wait!
No, Mother! No more lies! 
Dude, where's the money?
There is no money.
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
I know!
Cartman, what's going on?!
You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
Tell us what?!
You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
No, man, that's just a TV show.
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
What? That your parents lied to you, too?
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
How?
The kid will never even know.
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Yeah. 
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  "Tooth Fairy."
Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
Got it. 
This is the smartest business venture ever. 
What the-? 
Because that's what we're doing!
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp.
We were there first!
Amazing.
Man, that is tits!
It's that, or else I can cut off your penises. 
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
I'll cut you in at 2%.
Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-
Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 
Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
That's right. Keep the change, my man.
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
Sure, Kyle.
I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! 
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
That's right, yeah  . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?
How much?
Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh? 
Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Huh?
These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!
This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
Will somebody take those books away from him?
Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss?  Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh.
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski , put this buttwipe out of his misery. 
I got it!
What the hell?
Kyle?
I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
...Tits.
Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow. 
You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 
Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! 
Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu
Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
Two hours.
Awwwgh.
(Woohoo!) 
Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 
Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
(Hunh?)
Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
Hurry up, you guys!
What's going on?
Hello.
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
(Hey!)
But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
What are we going to do now? 
You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.
How can you say that?
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Hooray!
Hooray!
You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 
Damn, we might be screwed.
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!
Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah. 
And shopping malls! Hooray! 
Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!
Dude, what the hell happened?
Yeah! Well, not this time!
Huh?
I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us. 
Take that! 
Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago , and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!
Yeah, you suck, dude!
And you Romanian leaders , you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!
Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
Yeah!
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
Yeah, screw them!
Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about...
Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.
Wendy?
Phew!
Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
Kyle?
Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
Yeah, me too.
Hooray.
Hoo-ray.
Yes.
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh.  Timmeh!
That was awesuhome!
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
Rown! 
Did you guys see that?
Okay, children, let's settle down!  Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex.  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
There you go. 
Rowr.
Whah!
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
Sounds good.
So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. 
Come, see him with us.
Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  She's on my back! Hah! 
Come on, drink it down. It's free.
You'll be inside of me...
Rowr.
Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
Yeah. 
Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh
And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B.  So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed,  all masterpieces of literature like this one.  Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night.
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
Um, deny it?
Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. 
Sweet.
Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
What?
I just gave you AIDS.
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 
We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 
God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
What?
I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
I'm Bill Kurtis.
I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: "Men Who Like Young Boys"  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  "So what are you into?"  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  "Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?"  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  "Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning."  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
Yeah. You're -Eric?
Yeah! 
I brought you some candy.
Wow, cool!
And some books on Kama Sutra.
Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. 
Huh?
Huh?
No! 
What the hell just happened?
(Woohoo!) 
Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  "Hi. I'm eight and a half inches." Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
Hi there.
Mr. Garrison??
Haah! Eric!
You wanna be my friend?
Oh, crap!
That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
No-o!
Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
We're making faces at sick people.
No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! 
We don't know.
I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
YES I AM!! 
I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick-  Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman.
Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
Well of course, come in.
You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.
NAMBLA?
Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 
What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you?
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
You... do?
Sure.
Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
...Sweet.
(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 
Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
What are you talking about, fatass?
Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 
Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child.
Thanks, dude. 
Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child.
Really? Awesome!
Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. 
Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.
KIIICK ASS!
Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! 
Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
They are?
We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
We don't wanna go!
You can't go.
We don't WANNA go!
No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
Kenny, what the hell are you doing?! 
What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
We got invited too, fatass!
Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys.
Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.
Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
They're all over the place.
Yeah.
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
How?
Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
Now, are you a team player or not?!
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
Well uuh-uuh-alright then. 
Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
Well, Cartman
Well, what?
Yeah!
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. 
Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland. 
Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?
Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.
Dude, what the hell was that?
Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
Huh?
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
Not with me, man.
Awww. 
He's fakin'! 
Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) 
"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
(No, no.)
Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)  (There! It's mine!) 
No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
Yeah.
Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 
Okay, mom.
And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 
What's goin' on, guys?
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
Oh-kay.
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
Uh huh.
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
But you only need one, fat boy!
No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
(It's not that's fucking serious.) 
Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
How much?
I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons.
No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
Oh well, we're busted. 
Shut up, Fluffy! 
Oh, phew.
Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
You suck, Cartman!
Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!
Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
Alright, alright, here. 
Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
Why, hello there, Eric. 
You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.
Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  If you'll just sign this release. 
Thank you. 
Yeah.  Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too.
Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
Huh?
Isn't that funny, sweetie?
Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
Oh. ...Thanks?
I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
Huh?  What the?
Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been… Cartman.
Thaaat's ri-ight.
Yeah.
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Yes I do!
No you don't!
Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
It's okay, I'm here.
Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
What??
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
Wwuhuh-o-kay! 
The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
Right. 
Mmmm.
Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.
You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
The South Park flag!
Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
D'aaaaahhh!
Whoa! Calm down, ho. 
This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
You won't let me help.
That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
Uh huh.
Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
Huh?
I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.
Yeah.
Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. 
Cool.
Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. 
Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."
Hey, that's what I always do, too!
No way!
Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
Me neither. 
Aha ha.
Huh.
Well, anyway, let's get back to work. 
Whoa.
Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- 
Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.
Cartman! 
Ahh! 
Say it'll be like this forever.
Okay, It will be like this forever.
AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. 
Wendih.  Wendih. 
Aaaah!
Wendih, look at me.
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. 
Me, too!
I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
I'm totally back to normal. See you later. 
Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.

Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 
...How?
Boy band.
Boy band?
Boy band.
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
So?
So, all boy bands have five members.
What?
He's right.
Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest

Ahah-oo well, alright then. 
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!
Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.

Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
Dude, she's a chick!
Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
"Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! 
(Me too.)
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
Yeah!
Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
Costumes? 
Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
I wanna be the tough one.
...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
I wanna be the tough one!
You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
Jews are tough!
Since when?!
Since Abraham, fatass!
Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways?
I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
Kenny says that's not what it means.
Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then?
(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous.
Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?
We're goin' to see the mall manager.
You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir.
But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
Jesus Christ!
Oh, God, I can't see! 
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 
Cool.
Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
Jesus, they're gonna start a riot! 
Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!
What? Hey. Who are you? 
We... are Fingerbang!
O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?
Alright! Let's do it, boys! 
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
Alright, that's enough!
--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
Thank you.
Well, so can we play here?
What?? ...No.
No??
Who?? No!
Why not?!
Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?
You don't think we're any good, do you?!
No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.
Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric.
Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. 
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 
Alright, Eric, what's the matter?
Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 
Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
What's the Gomlich effect?
The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."
So how do boy bands use that?
All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. 
Thanks!
You're welcome. Now, go away!
Okay. 
A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 
Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. 
Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
Huhaaaaah!
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
Yeah.
Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
...Matt Lauer.
...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
Oh... Okay. 
Roll camera!
AAAGGGGHHH! 
Jesus Christ!
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
Okay, so where's our money?
Oh uh, Kyle has it. 
Wuh? 
Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 
God damnit! 
Hello again!
What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
Oh. What?
If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 
Timmiihh! 
Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 
Haaghh.  Timmih, livin' a lie!
Son of a bitch!
Hey. This video is dumb.
You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while.
Really? You will?
Only for twenty minutes, though.
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
Oh. Okay. 
Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 
Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? 
Aw, Mom!
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
Where the hell is Stan?!
He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?
Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. 
Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.
(Yeah!)
Oh, god-damnit!
Hm... Well, let's just walk away then. 
God damnit! People are walking away! 
Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.
Just another minute.
Sorry. Get out! 
Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
It's Stan! 
Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
Dude, where the hell have you been?!
Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.
We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, "I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
You bastards!
No! He can't be dead!
Dude, he's pretty dead.
No! We were so close!
Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!
But we have to perform!
Oh, yes we do.
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Fingerbang!
Bang bang 
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang 
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!
Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
Can I get your autograph?
Ok-Okay, okay.
Move along, ma'am.  Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime.
Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
Yeah.
I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...
Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation." 
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation."
(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
No no, no. Separation.
BOYS! You are in CHURCH! 
Ugh!
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion.
A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Yeah, what if we haven't?
It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works.  The priest will give you this round cracker,  and he will say, "The Body of Christ," and then you eat it. 
Jesus was made of crackers?
In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, "eat this, for it is my body."
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ.
Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!
Nno!
Then stop questioning me.
But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
Oh yeah, okay.
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Right, I already got that one.
No-o-o-o-o!
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
Oh good. I don't?
No, you're already going to hell.
I am not!
You are, too!
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
Timmiih!
What'd we do to Timmy?
Timmiih!
Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
How was it?
Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
Huh?
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Who's in there?
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Well, here goes everything. 
Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?
Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.  I'll see if I can find him. Bye. 
And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
Your  con- confession does not leave this box.
Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew.
No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 
I... see.
Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
Okayokay, fine! 
Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.
What happened??
I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
HAAAAH!
Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
Cartman!
What?
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Oh, now you've said it, too!
(Fuck! Oops!) 
Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
But what about them?
Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
He had sins that he didn't confess!
And he never took Communion!
...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
Yeah. 
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Come on, hurry up! 
Oh no! It's locked!
What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
Confession box is over there! 
I'm first, I'm first! 
Oh, huhuh.
What the? 
You're a sinner!
You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!
Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
No, I can't.  What am I doing? I know this is the wrong thing to do. I could lose Chris. I can't do this.  I can't do this. 
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
Pamphlet. Pamphlet. 
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
I don't wanna to go to hell. 
It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
I told him he couldn't do it. 
I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 
Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?
I will.
Praise God-uh!
¿Qué?
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.
Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 
Wow, cool.
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
What?
This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
Aww.
Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?
(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)
Oh my God!!
What?
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
Ask him what hell is like.
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
No! Not like this..!
Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
Wagghh..!
He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
Whoa!
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 
You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
Stephen?  Stephen, no!
The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
Forgive us, Lord.
Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
Awww.
Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 
Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.
Sister, have you read this book?
Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.
Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives.
Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
No.
We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 
...And I'm gonna save all of you right now.  I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
Well...
Ow!  Goo-aagh..! 
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
Yes!
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
Yes!
That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
Ow! 
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
Uh, I think so.
Praise the Lord-uh!
Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God! 
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
Timmiiiy!
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
Timmiiiy!
Devil be  gone-uh!
Haagggh.
Now walk, Timmih! 
Haagggh.
Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
Haghh.
The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 
Timmilih? 
He walks-uh!
Oh-aagghhh! 
Yes! Praise the Lord!
Do dodo dum do dodoDo dodo dum do dodo
For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 
Denver.
And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
Wooooo!
Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
Hooray!
For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
Yes!
He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!
Wagh...
Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!"
No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein,  was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 
Oooh, yeah. I'll do that.
Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
What worked?
Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
You're keeping that money yourself?
Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
Then why didn't you tell us?!
My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
Suck my balls!
Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 
Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!
Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
Jesus!
Uh-oh.
Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.
Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
Yeah. 
No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
You're gonna send me to hell?
(Eric! Eric!)
Aw, crap!
Stupid third grader!
Yeah,  get out of here! 
Uhuhuhow.
There, that's better.
Denver? 
U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 
YEAH!!!
Why, that's PERfect!
Huhuh, look at all this stuff.
Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?!  I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  And it is time to go to work!
KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.
Oh, I'm sure I do.
This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! 
I'm trying.
Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.
Fantastic, then.
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
You guys are all such pussies!
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
Huh?
Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
Huh-it sure was.
I wish I was still there.
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.
Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!
We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 
What are you doing?!
We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!
You're damn right they do!
No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! "The Menagerie" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!
Who the hell cares?!
And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world. 
God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
Alright, children, I hope you all did your-  Oowhat is going on now?! 
Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
Oh Good Gravy, not this again.
Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
I'll kill you! 
There it is! Come on, everybody! 
Children, get back into your seats!
No way, lady!
Eric, I mean it!
You can suck my balls!
Present them. 
...What?
Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
Touché, teacher. Touché.
Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 
What??
Cool!
Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?
Yeah, that's me.
Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
Yeahhh, you already know about it?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Well...  "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
No, I don't! I don't care!
Here, Kyle. 
Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. 
And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?
Trapper Keeper active.
Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
Ready for hybrid. 
And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
I'm gonna!
Hold it.
Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend?  I mean, friend?
I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.
Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!
Okay, that's cool.
Can we play some human tetherball?
A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- 
Serve! 
Ugh..! 
Got it!
Ey!
Waa-agggh! 
You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!
Wagh!
Got ya! 
Whoa, dude..!
Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
Please. You do not understand.
Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper.
You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
Yes!
Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 
Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right.
Hey, dudes.
Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
Why the hell not?!
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
Cartman!
Ech! Screw you guys. Home. 
Recharging.
Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
Oh, cool.
Whoa...
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--
Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.
Huh? 
Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid.
Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!
Not-- Aw, damnit..! 
What are you doing, Kyle?
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Screw you, fat ass!
Hey, screw you.
Cartman! 
Agh--! 
Huh, that's a bitch.
Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
Awww, man...
Cartman!
Alright, alright.  Kyle...
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
Can we take a lunch break now?
No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
Agh oh-ight, Timmih!
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
How good?
Oh yeah, we can't!
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
Yeah
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
Okay!
This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
Aw, blow it out your ass!
Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show.
Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
GOBBLES! 
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
GOBBLES! 
Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire.
Cool! Can you get it for us?
Gobbles!  Gobbles!  Up, heh. Uh!  Heeey, Gobbles!  Gobbles.  Gobbles! 
No no! 
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
Now, hon!
But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
Twenty more minutes, and that's it. 
Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to "Phantom Of The Opera"?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
OP-pression!
Oh.  Cool! He's here! 
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America!  Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia! 
Yeh.
Wow.
Whoa.
Of course she is! 
Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?
What... is... that?!
Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. 
Gobbles.
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
Tim-mih.
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright. 
Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
Kill the other turkey!
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
Well, it could meet with "an unfortunate accident."
Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.
It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!
Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 
How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!
Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
Whoa-aaaa 
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
But what are we gonna do?
Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! 
Thanks. 
Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 
How is it going, Eric?
Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing.
Like what?
Let's see.  Helen Keller was blind and deaf.  Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here. 
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow... 
Oh, man!
Well, did you see anything?
No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
...Oh, that's too bad.
Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!
Gobbles.
Alright everybody, let's take our places!
Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far. 
Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
Timmih?
Union Mafia bastards! 
Gobbles!! 
Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on.
...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel.
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
Aaaa, Timmih!
Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! 
They loved it! They LOVED it!
Alright, see you next year, parents. 
That's it?
Waitwait. Hunh.
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
AAHahahahahahaaa!
Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
Eh yes, sweetie.
Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? 
Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.
God, I have to everything around here!
Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
What?!
We believe that you might have a problem.
You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Fat camp?
Yes, fat camp.
Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
Oh, we'll change that.  Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?
Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie.
Don't touch me! 
Have you got any candy?
No.
Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
Doing great kids! Come on! 
This... is... bullcrap!
Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?
I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
Take it! I can't eat this crap!
Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
Can I interest you in some ice cream?
You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? 
Hunh?  Uuh! 
They tricked us again, huh?
Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA! 
I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
Memememeee! 
Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy.
Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
What?!
I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!
Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
Twenty.
Suck my balls, 20!
Fine! Then I shall bid you good day! 
Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 
They'll do it!! 
Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 
Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please.
Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this.  All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself. 
Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
I'd, I do?
Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.
Oh, don't thank us. We failed you.
...65, 66, 67... 
Wait a second! This isn't right!  It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!
Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son? 
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
Yeah.
What?!
Bubbye. 
Well, screw you, fatasses! 
Hepatitis B?
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
Ah. Oh, now I already told them.
Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
How?!
Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
The police?
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
What's that?
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  "my parents molestered me."
"My parents molestered me."
No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  "My parents molestered me."  And then they'll say something like, "Was it a good touch or a bad touch?" and you say  "Uh, it was a good touch" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
What's "bad touch"?
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
Okay, molestered, bad touch.
Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
You guys! Come out here! 
What's going on?
Notice anything?  Watch. 
...Nothing.
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
The mayor! Good! Finally!
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
No phones, either? How do you communicate?
Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 
It's gonna be about three days. 
So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?
SpitBall!
Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 
Oh no. NO!  Aaaah! 
Where is your husband?
Uh, uh...
Seize her! 
Sure, outlander. I'll get it 
Outlander! 
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Butters, calm down, alright?
Fishing's good. Uh huh. 
I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 
Mmrrhhhh!
Heh, heheh.
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! 
The Provider awakes!
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 
Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
Take him down. 
Sure. 
Snow igloos kick ass. 
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
Heh-tchoo!
Dude, you sneezed on my back!
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey!
Family?
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
Sure we'll help! 
Anything for more presents!
Honey, can we go inside for a second?  Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 
Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
How hard can it be? Look at it. 
Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
Whoa!
Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.
That's not me, that's you!
What?!
They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! 
What's a hard p?
You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
...deh..OOOWW!!!
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
Don't call me fat, buttfucker.
Cartman!
Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. 
Thank you, thank you. 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.
Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
I guess- we might as well- go home now. 
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
Yeah, ham.
No not ham!
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
Wow! Count me in!
Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
What, doughboy?
I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
So?
So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
What?
No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
What?!
You'll never guess.
What?!
Guess.
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  "Shit."
They can't say "shit" on television!
It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
It's stupid!
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -
Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
I can't believe they actually said it. 
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form
Huh?
You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  "That's a shitty picture of me." is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  "This is a picture of shit." is still naughty. 
I don't get it.
Yes, that's now fine.
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. 
What's meecrob?
You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
What's that?
Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
Oh.
Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
Cartman, this is serious!!!
So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 
Holy shit!
Oh-Ho, gross!
(Uh oh.)
Kenny's got it. heh heh.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. 
Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
Then  get out of here before we have you thrown out!
But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
And asshole.
I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
All the world destroyed?
My house, too?
Wait! 
Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 
Agh. Dude, lame. Lame!  Bummer, dudes. 
What a stupid voice.
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. 
Holy shi-  poop.
Hah, I love you guys.
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
Hyeah Timmay!
Yeah, he's excited.
Hey, fellas!
Hey, Butters.
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
Hey, yeah!
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
Yahahah!!!
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
That's better.
Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? "Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!" 
Hehe, I don't sound like that.
Timmih! 
Cripple fight! 
That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats! 
Awww!
Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! "We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"
Man, this guy sucks.
Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
Kicked out? Oh no!
But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
Puppies. Puppies for sale.
Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 
Timmih, Timmh.
Cripple fight!
Timmih.
Cripple fight! 
Uh yeah, ah I think so.
Eh, we kick ass.
That's pretty cool, dude!
Who's this asshole?
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.
When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?
Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
That's right.
Cool.
I'm Kyle.
Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic.
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
So you're not a cult?
Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
Well, alright, come on in.
Cool. 
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
No, not really.
Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
He's going to eat his own head.
Oh, I can't go.
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
I am happy.
No you're not.
Yes I am.
No you're not.
I really am.
No you're not.
But I am.
No you're not.
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. 
It's Jesus! 
What's he doin' here? 
My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle!  Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn around.  Okay, now turn back. 
Now how the hell did he do that? 
Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 
It's just me.
Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
What?
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
What have you done, Cartman?!
This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause.
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?
Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
But it's the only way for us to be happy. 
We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott!
Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .
It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! 
Hey, I was just about to do it.
Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 
Haha, hehahaha.
Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! 
And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
What's no big deal?
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
...What the hell are you talking about?!
Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! 
Oh.  No you didn't!
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
He's lying. 
You wanna see 'em?
Hell no! 
Here, check 'em out.
We don't wanna see them, Cartman! 
There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
Uh what are those? 
My pubes.
What??
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
Uh oo what?
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
Nuh uh!
Yuh huh!
But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
Yeah.
Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
Uh uh, I don't take returns!
Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
Just give me back my money...
Buyer beware, dude!
Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! 
Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
You will? Oh, cool!
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.
...Okay.
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
Right.
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
Cool.
And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. 
Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
Cartman, can I give you some advice?
What?!
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! 
(One please.)
One please. 
That'll be six dollars.
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
We don't take pubes!
Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
Racist! 
Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!
What?
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?
No reason.
I don't believe you.
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
Pube fair?
They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
Hehere, take your money!
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
Haha, charade you are, Scott! 
Have you no heart??
Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! 
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
Yes?
Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
The pube fair?
Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
There's no such thing, you little smartass! 
No- no such thing?
Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Karp-man, would you?
I'm Eric Cartman!
Well, I think this is for you. 
Aaah!!!
You really went? What a 'tard.
Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
Your grandma?
Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.
Yeah. Poor grandma...
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. 
Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. 
Here you go.
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! 
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
What?
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
Huh?
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
Why??
Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
Please Scott give me my money.
Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say "I beg you to give me back my money."
I beg you to give me back my money.
Now say, "I'm a little piggy."
What?!
Say it!
I'm a little piggy.
"Here's my snout."
Here's my snout.
"Oink oink oink."
Oink oink oink.
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!
You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. 
What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! 
Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
Wuh what are you gonna do?
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
What's in it for us?
What?
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, "It's not your problem." But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, "You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"  Now who's with me?!! 
Timmay!
Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. 
There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
He said it was okay.
Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
Not like that, pony! 
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 
Whattayou mean?
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
How do I do that?
What do you see? 
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
Oo what's a Radiohead?
You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...
Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!
So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.
Nice thinking, young hunter.
Whoa!
What?
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
Mn let me see.
Radiohead. Yes, of course. 
Whoa, I gotta get out of here! 
Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
Uh huh.
Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!
Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.
You're welcome, Scott. 
Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now.  Guys, when is the next album coming out?
That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
And will there be a new tour?
Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! 
'"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' 
Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
Got what all figured out?
How to get Scott Tenorman back!
Oh, Jesus!
I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 
Okay, so what's the plan?
It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
Yeah.
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 
...What?
Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 
You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 
...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 
See ya. 
Hello, Scott!
Hey.
I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
Wow, a pony ride. Neat.
Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
A little penis-biting, perhaps?
What?
Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
How can I turn it down?
Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. 
Yeah! 
Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
What's so funny?
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
Not yet, but they will be.
Hello, Eric!
Hey, Chef.
I made some chili to enter into the contest.
What contest?
This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
It's my special recipe.
Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!
Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. 
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
Alright.  Hey, this is great! 
Eh, it's a special recipe.
Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? 
What?!
Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. 
My... mom and dad are... dead? 
I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."
Oh my God!  Oh my God!! 
Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! 
No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!
Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
Good call.
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! 
And so, in her career filled with lies, backstabbing, and whoring herself for money,  she learned that the price of fame can be pleasing 65 men at once in a dark, dirty alley.  And so ends "Punky Brewster, Behind The Blow."
Whoa, bummer, dude.
Oh man, this is another rerun.
Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
Oh my God!
You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
Awesome! Give me mine! 
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Yeah.
And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
Well yeah, dude.
Uuuuhh.
Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
I think this new guy's funny.
Then get in the "Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club" line. 
Aw, dude, gay!
You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face! 
Racist! 
Are you guys official presidents, too?
Don't talk to us, kid.
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Kenny's a random slut. 
OH!!! 
Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! 
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
Weak.
Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 
Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
Good luck, boys. 
We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
They're back!
Alright!
It sure did.
Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman.  She was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother , and a loving grandmother .
Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.
Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives. 
God! She didn't take this long to die.
Peace. 
Great. Now can we go?
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
Ogh! God-damnit..!
..."And so I leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family."
Mom, I wanna go home!
"To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did."
Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
"To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler."
Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
"For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately."
Hoosajiggawha?
That can't be!
Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
Yes, Eric, it's yours.
No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
And now, you do.
Egh... 
...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million. 
Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
On what?
On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker; I can help you invest that money.
Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church.
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 
Kenny wasn't lying.
Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
What?
What?!
Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris.  The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up.
Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
You... you're not?
No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. 
Gentlemen, I thank you.
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah! Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!
Hunh, I guess you're right.
Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
What the hell?
Hohohooho! Oowwww!
You sons of bitches! 
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
What the hell are you doing?!
Alright, let's go.
That's right! You stay out!
You'll see! We'll get in! 
...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
So what does does this job pay?
Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.
But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
I'm not interested.
Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
If you need security, I need a cash salary.
But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary.
Ugh... Two people?
This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
I will shoot on sight.
Sweet.
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. 
That's gay.
I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
Oh. 
The rest of you will just have to try another day.
Aw. 
'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
Hoh boy, oh boy! 
...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!
What?
Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.
But I don't know how it works.
Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
Timmay!
Wait a minute! Who are you?
Mike Gainor. 
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!
I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
Get him out of here! 
AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!
Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! 
Kyle? Kyle?  Get the doctor!
Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! 
(Woohoo!)  (Heeheehee!!) 
AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!
Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!
Hey, there you are! 
Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.
Just give me my money back.
What?
I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
...But it's doing great!
You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!
Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! 
Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
Yeah?
I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy.  Seize the assets. 
He-hey, that's my money!
There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this. 
What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court. 
Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
Nohoho way, José!
But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
"I don't care," said Pierre. "I'm from France." 
This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
Then damnit man, do it!
It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! 
Huh?
You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! 
Huh?
I'M SO PISSED OFF! 
Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!
Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! 
That's it, baby. That's it.
Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! 
Whoa! Awesome!
Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
Oh no, what now?
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
(Yeah they do!)
Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!
That's awesome!
I told you guys.
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
You "beat off?"
That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
AIDS?
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
Would you rather them do it unprotected?
Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
Just put it on, Butters.
Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
...Pretty good.
Do you feel protected?
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. 
Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
Why are you wearing a condom?
So I don't get AIDS.
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
Yeah! You get out of town!
Here, talk to them, Butters.
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
(Waa-ooo!) 
Oh, bitch!
Jesus Christ. 
Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
Yeah. Thank God.
Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
Let a man take a crap!
Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!
I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 
Eric, put that down!
Why?
Just go put it back in the trashcan!
Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
No that... that came from me; just put it away.
This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
Cool!
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
Thirst For BLOOD!
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
Oh, this is so cool.
Bring it, bring it! 
G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
Date-rape psychosis.
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
Awesome!
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
Okay... You sure?
Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! 
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
That's... so... cool!
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
It's Monday?
Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at...  Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! 
What, dude? 
Where the hell is it??
Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
No! ...No!
Towelie!
Hey, towel!
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!
I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
No it isn't.
Is!
No it isn't.
Brake, Kenny, brake. 
Egh!
Huh where are you goin'?
This is where you came from?
Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
Hurry up, stupid parachute!
Alright, I think we go over there. 
Hey it's been a long time!
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
Don't preach to me, fatso!
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
You're stupid!
Yeah, and you're a towel!
That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! 
Could you turn it up?
Oooww! 
Hup hup. Come on, hang on. 
(Help help! Heeelllppp!) 
Kenny!
You asshole.
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
Alright!
Hooray!
Don't forget to bring a towel. 
You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
...Not really.
Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!
Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
These are a weapon! 
Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
I'll think of a way. Now move along!
God-damnit! 
Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan.  So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
Eric, the Afghan people need our help!
Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!
God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
My parents will never let me keep a goat
Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
Excuse me?
It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
Aaagh!
Oh no, not Towelie.
Do you wanna get high?
No, we don't wanna get high!!
You mean, you don't want Towelie around?
That's right!
Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
Let's head out. 
Aw, son of a bitch!
(Ee-hew-hoo!)
Uh ho, you guys.
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
I don't smell any- boh! Oh God!  Hohhgh!  Blagh!  Bleeaagghh 
Uh, whatever!
You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
Ma-a-a-a-a.
God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
Hello. We need to go...  here. 
What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. 
Huh!&#160;!آمریکایی‌ها با خوک می‌خوابن Americans are pig fuckers!
What did you call us?!
Hey! Hey, open the door!
I told you! Jawas have no heart.
Jawas?
You know, sand people.
Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
God, I hate you so much, Stan!
Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
Good job, fatass!
Dude, don't call me a Canadian! 
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
Amalama hamahamahama?  Una Haqa mala
Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
Cartman, where are you going??
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
Cartman, he's crazy!
He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 
A flippity flappity floop! Jihad jihad!

Yeah, go Broncos.
Yeah. 
No. This is taking forever.
You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!
What, Cartman?
Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! 
It isn't that funny, Cartman.
Yes it is! 
Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! 
...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
Very nice. Okay, last one? 
Uh oh. 
Okay, have a seat, young man.  Well, okay, lookin' great. Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! 
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
Should be about four days.
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-
YES! YES!
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
Let me see! 
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
(You've ever done?!)
Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 
Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!
Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!
Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!
Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 
Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?
Yes, I have it right hmya. 
O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.
You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? 
Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye! 
Okay, brown eye...
And, and big rosy cheeks! 
...Full cheeks...
Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! 
Hello?
You guys! You guys! You guys! 
Hello?
...You guys!... 
Cartman?
You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. 
Why'd you call us?
Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! 
That isn't funny, Cartman.
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. 
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! 
...Nuh uh.
Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. 
Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. 
Oh God.
We understand you've seen our son. 
Oh my... God. 
Yeah, you missed them turning around.
You guys, something's wrong.
What?
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
Blew a funny fuse?
It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?
You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, "Friends" . Ohokahay, huhuh.
Ugh.
Aww
Oh, dude, oh.
Dude, what's wrong with you?
Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! 
What's this all about?
Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
Okay, let me have it.
Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
Okay, why?
Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. 
...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
Who's there?
Orange.
Orange who?
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
...naw, that didn't work either.
Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.
Who's there?
An interrupting ca'ow.
An interrupting cow who
Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 
Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
Oh, son! 
What's goin' on?
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.
Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
A-heh, what?
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! 
Hey dude.
What's that thing?
Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.
What?
That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
Forty bucks?
But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
Alright, alright.
And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
...Oh, man.
Cartman?!
Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. 
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
Ugh, ugh!
Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.
Oh!
Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
Oh my God.
Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
You did, too! You are so full of crap!
No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
You blew the deal, Cartman!
Goddamnit, give me another chance!
Oh no.
Haha,  serves you right, asshole. 
Think he'll be alright?
He's faaahn.
Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting. 
1, 2, 3, 4...
I hope he doesn't suffocate.
He's faaahn.
Yeah, haha.
Heheheheheh. 
Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about?  What did I learn about today?
I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
Dude! Weak.
...Good job, Jew!
Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?
Stand by, please.
NOW Eric!
Oh, god dammit!
Haha!
Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.
Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
Siddown. 
I'll make you eat your parents!
What did you say?!
Nothing! 
Alright! 
Aw, that is such bullcrap!
Eric, for the love of God. 
No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
My family isn't rich.
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
But I...
Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
Aharmani Exchange?
All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 
S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here.
Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
I sure did.
Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.
Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 
I only have this.
Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. 
What's a VHS?
Oh, Jesus, dude. 
Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!
What in the hell are they doing?
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Well, let's just play our game, then.
Alright.
Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 
I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! 
Kick his nutsack! 
And Cartman for being fat.
Uh huh.
And Cartman for being stupid.
Yeah.
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
Hey.
And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
Ey, you did me already!
Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
Pussy. 
...going places that I've never been
Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh!  Jesus Christ!! 
My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
What?
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
A trampoline?
Better.
A boat?
Better.
(A football machine?)
Better.
Well WHAT, Cartman?
Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.
...What? 
Mint condition, tax free.
I'm leaving right now! 
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
Stem cells, numbnuts!
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
...I hate you so much. 
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.
Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.
You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.
...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.
Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. 
Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.
Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
They say it's an emergency.
Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?
Uh, yeah?
Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
Eh, just about.
Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
Oh. Well, uh okay. 
Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
What is this, a PTA meeting? 
Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.
In the ...hospital? Why?
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
Die? Kenny?
I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. 
(I'm okay, I guess.)
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
Heh, sorry. 
I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.
Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
Cartman?
Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? 
Cartman, were you... crying?
' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.
Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.
Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?
Not at all, but go on. 
Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine.
My God...
Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.
So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
That's the theory.
Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber.
Hmmm.
But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.
Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. 
Where are you going?
There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell. 
Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks. 
Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck. 
Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. 
I think I understand.
My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
One thing led to another; we were young 
And we would scream together songs unsung
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what our hearts meant
The heat of the moment
shone in your eyes
And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
Oh, I don't know.
Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright.
Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? 
We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
Oh Mark, I love you.
Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
You guys! Come quick! 
What, Cartman?
It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! 
What, Cartman? What's happened?
Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked! 
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.
AAARGH! 
Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! 
Ye-!  wait, what?
Huho!
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
We sure are.
Lin
Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. 
Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease.
Hello, is this City Wok?
Yes, this Shitty Wok.
Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!
Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
Alright! 
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides.
A- AIDS?
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
Tha- that's diarrhea.
Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.
That's a great idea!
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
Me?!
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
But Butters isn't fat.
That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
He used to be fat but not no more 
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
Fifty pounds? Why?
Uuuh, school project.
I'm runnin' out, children. 
Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
So how long until we can joke about it?
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
Then eat your puke.
No!
Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. 
W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!
Get a hold of yourself, man!
Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today?
Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
Which one? I see two fat friends.
The fat one!
Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!
Just like Jared.
All right!
Sir, we are in business!
His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway and... sandwiches of...
Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
Well alright then.
Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
Yeah, we're all set.
Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
Wow! 
Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
All prepared for liposuction surgery?
Check.
Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
That should blah  ah- here. 
Woahhh!
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
Alrighty.
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
Alright, I think it's in. 
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
Bohogh, egh. 
Waaaahh!
There it goes.
Alright, it's working!
Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
We've gotta hurry this up. 
Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
He's losing weight. 
Oh, whoa. Whoa! 
Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
Oh, crap!
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
Yep.
Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
No- but you don't sound like me.
Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. 
Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
I'm just checking in on you, Butters.  Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!
Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
Jacking it? Jacking what?
Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!
Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just Wait until I get home!
Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes! 
God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
Hello?
Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
Huh. Huh, uh, uh.
There you are, Butters!
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
Hu-oh! Goody!
Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
Uh- perfect.
Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
Butters, it was my pleasure. 
Aaaa!! 
Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!
Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
He's such a douchebag
Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 
Yeah, and then what?
And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh
It's lovely. Thank you.
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
What
So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
What's a Hitler?
You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
No, I never have.
Shh-shh, here he comes.
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
I don't smell anything. Do you guys? 
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. 
All right, little dudes,  great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor. 
His name is Thumper?
...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
Ugh, no more., 
Let's dance. 
Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 
Hey Kenny! 
That's awesome, Kenny. 
Hello, Maury. 
Aww, sick dude!
Cool!
Oh YES!! 
What disease should we say?
Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis."  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?
What? 
Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
Cool!
Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!
We-ell hold on a second, you guys.
Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
Yeah.
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
Yeah.
We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside.
Nice.
Aw, I feel silly.
They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. 
That's your flight, Butters.
Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
Testicles and scrotum! 
They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
Uh oh, we're losin' him.
Phew.
Oh, that was close.
Wait, here it is, here it is!
The present.
Wow!
Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?
Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic.
What's the new topic?
Please help my out-of-control child.
Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
Really?  Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
Uh, sure!
Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies
Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.
...my, my mom?
Yes, sweetie?
Could yo do me a favor?
What's that, my little man?
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?
Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
Orf course I do.
Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
Sweetie, don't.
Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.
Wha'evah! Maury, my mom don't know shit! You could aks her! I aks her all my homies that they be down wit it. You know, it's all good shit.  Fuck you, cocksuckuhs!
Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins
But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. 
Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! 
Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.
Oooohhh!
What-evah! What-evah!  I'll do what I waunt!
Oh, what-evah. You ain't tough, ho! I roam with gangs!
Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! 
What Evah! You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! I ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom!
What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
What evah!
I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting.
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!
Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! 
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 
Get him!
Aaahh! 
Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. 
They look so delicious. 
Hey, anybody want a free sample?
Memememee!
Huh, me neither.
Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
What??
Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?
Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.
Alriiight!
Pst, Cartman.
No, Uncle Jesse, no!
Cartman, wake up!
What? What the hell are you guys doing??
Come on, we've gotta go!
Where are we going?
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
What? Why?
'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
So?
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass," "butthole," and "douchebag." I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 
Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
What?!
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
Screw you, Cartman!
Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.
No!
Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.
Have Butters kiss it.
No, it has to be Kyle. 
Awww! 
Oh man, that was soho awesome!
Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
Hell, I'm not goin' with you!
Hyaaaa! 
Heeeey! 
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 
Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
They aren't leaving.
See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
I don't know.
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
Eh! 
Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. 
Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
I want out.
Yeah!
Yeah! Wait-what?
Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.
Oh, God-damnit you guys.
Round one is over. We made it. 
We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
Wait, what is that?  Dude!
Food!
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
Look you guys! Beef jerky!
Me neither.
Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.For a... brighter tomorrow...
Hippies!
Ew, they're all dirty.
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
What do I say??
Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.
I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?
Sure, sure.
How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other.
What do you have in mind?
Well, how about you send out one of the calves?
Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
Just one, that's all we want.
All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
Dude! 
We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
What? I, I can't do that.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad.
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't!  Get them on the line for me!
Hello.
Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain.
All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. 
Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 
O-ogh...
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Damnit, I'm losing them.  Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf.
Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! 
Stan's getting worse, you guys.
Mike, speak.
How are we doin'?
We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word "veal" to "tortured baby cow." 
Good, good.
But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International.
And Worf?
Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
Step back! Tell those men to step back!
All right! Woohoo! Yeah!
Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as "Captain."
Where am I supposed to drive to?
No. See, must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?
You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
This whole thing is ridiculous!
"Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"
Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. 
Okay, all set!
Okay Cartman!
Step on it, Mr. Worf! 
Mexico here we come! 
Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
"Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"
Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads.
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it! 
Oh, it's a double-cross!!
Oh no! No!!
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
I'm NOT killing anybody!
Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
Thank God we stopped it in time.
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
All right!
No, turds!
Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
Shut up, fat turd!!
I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
Dude, I'm not going.
Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? 
Stan.
Stan, okay. What's your name? 
Kyle.
Kyle. What's your name? 
Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
Dude, thank God for stupid people 
Amen.
What a glorious day to spend a way, fight-in' round the world. 
What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. 
Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
Just just leave it alone.
Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 
That's worse!
Okay, how about ... that? 
God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
Dude, the commercials could start any time!
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
Hey! Imong telling Dat!
Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
This is Tianinman Square. Lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93.  These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look.  Oi!  I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end.  Gotcha mate!  Ah, you wanna fight, huh?!  Think you could take me, you little buggers?! 
God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? 
Aww! 
Argh!
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
It's a burning flag.
Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
-bloomin' Taj Mahal.
There, you got it, you got it!
We made it!
Oh, thank God.
Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.
We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight?  Crikey, you've done it now!
This TV is great, Chef.
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
Aagh! God-dammit!
We made it.
This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
Look, this is a bar! We can't have children in here. People come here for debauchery and sin!
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!
No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
Has Russell lost Tugger for good? Find out after these messages.
Here we go!
And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!
That's it? That's all the commercials?
Yeah. We don't like this show.
Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
Please.
Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
Awww!
Eewww!
That'd disgusting, dude!
God, I hate old people!
I told you, we can't go to my house!
And my house is being fumigated!
Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...
Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
AAAAA!!
The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! 
Don't go anywhere. Russell Crowe will be right back after a few more commercials. 
These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
They have to show it! They promised they would!
You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
Coming this summer! The greatest Canadian duo of all time is back.
Woohoo!!! 
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
Yeah, it sure does!
Who wants to tell him?
I'll do it.
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
Butters, could you take a seat, please?
Wuh well, sure. 
Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
Wull what is it?
Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap." 
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
Not working out?
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
Lame
Lame, yes.
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
Yes, well, we weren't.
We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
Who cares?
Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
...What if we don't want to be your friend?
Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. 
I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.
...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 
Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.
We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.
Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. 
Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
Aaarr! 
All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 
Timmay!
Next?
Sit down, boys.
Alrighty then. 
Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?
Uh, what's the question again?
Five... times...  one.
Five times one is of course...
Five.
Five. 
You're such a fatass, Cartman!
Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.
Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
What?
Just one more rose, Kyle.
Oh boy! Oh thank God! 
All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! 
This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. 
Okay wait...  No, no wait. 
Next please.
Anything that'll impress us, Token.
If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
Aaaah. Oh, I know. 
Very nice. 
Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!
Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.
All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
Okay, let's try this. 
Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
I think Towelie is awesome.
You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
How about Token? 
Token's a smartass.
So? You're a smartass!
Yeah. Do we really need another one?
Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
Oh, thanks Jimmy
Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. 
Alright Jimmy, see ya. 
Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 
Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please. 
Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 
Uh oh.
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
It's not?
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
No way.
Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
Nuh uh.
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
No way.
Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...
Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 
Ready. Let's see 'em.
Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. 
Are they playing basketball? 
What the fuck is this?! 
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
I got RIPPED OFF! 
I told you, Cartman.
Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
What are we gonna do with them?
Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
Yeah, that'd be funny.
Heheh, okay, okay.
Jesus Christ, we killed her!
Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
Tweek! Where are you going?
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
This is it.
Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!
Ugh.  Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word!
Dude, it's probably in her stomach. 
Is it her?
What do we do now?
Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...
Do you see the sea people.
No, just a bunch of goo.
Dwaah!!
There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. 
Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. 
Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. 
G'night, guys.
I'm so glad we're not murderers. 
Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
Oh no, what now? 
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! 
Wow. How did that happen?
I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!
Hr!
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
Well what are you gonna do?
Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
Can I help you?
Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
Your... mom told you?
Do you have them or not?
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
What's your name?
Frances Velman.
Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 
Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.
I see, very interesting. 
What are you doing?
Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
Five? Vials?
No, gallons.
Www-we don't have that much here.
Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 
Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
Well, drop them in! 
And I've got the sea men. 
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
That's cool.
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 
Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
Nothin' to do now but wait.
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Huh.
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
Cartman?
Ha ha! 
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
...So?
...Yeah. So?
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
Good for you!
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! 
Gaaa-hah!
Yeah! Go! 
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Oh God-damnit! 
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Why can't societies just live in peace?
What are they talking about?
I don't know.
Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt? 
Ih... in our... butt?
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
Maybe... No.
In your butts?
Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Hm.
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
What?
It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
Yeah.
Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
It wouldn't work!
Have you ever tried it?
I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
You're on, fat boy!
Okay, let's go, Jew! 
Well, Cartman?
Hold on!  God, let a man crap!
Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
You've had five, dude!
I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 
Get the fuck out of here!
Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
Gelgameks?
Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
What?
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!
You guys! You guys! Look! 
Harrr!
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
So?
So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly.
That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!! 
You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
So?
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
You were totally, one hundred percent right.
Heh...  what?
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! 
Aw, dude, why would they do that?
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
Goddamnit, that pissed me off!
Yeah, we want our money back!
Sorry, suckers! 
You asshole! 
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club
Yeah
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
I'm not! I'm not a team player!
Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!
Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
Well what's wrong with it?
Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 
"Free hat?"
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
But we don't have hats!
Well we can just make them out of paper.
Aahh!
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
My center. My... center.  Calm  Cup? 
Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!
Gaaaaah!
How many hats have you made?
Oh God!
We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!
A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!
Oh God!
I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
Eh- Excuse me?
Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
But just remember that I do all the talking.
You?? Why?
Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
When did we do dibs for it?
Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! 
Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
What could possibly go wrong?
A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?
...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 
You're here.
Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 
Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
Yeah, we're children.
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
How so?
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
YEAH!
He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
Hwaaah!
Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
Haaah!
People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
That's it!
Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
Huh uh.
Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
Oh God, no! Not Plan B! 
You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? 
...What??
Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
...No, he has an icy heart.
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
It's a cool island song.
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
Oh, do we wanna do that?
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
Wow.
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
AY!
Yeah. I I think so.
Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
That and youth. Those guys are old.
Cartman likes to play with dolls?
Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Bark bark bark bark!
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
Please, mister, let me out.
It puts the lotion back in the basket!
I miss my Mom, mister. I wanna see my Mommy-
Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
Sweetie.
Yes Mom?
You have to get ready for school
...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
You'll get over it, honey.
But I wanna plaaayyy.
M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?  I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? 
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
I don't know. Why?
It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
Yeah, may be.
Hellafun
Right, heh.
Oh yeah.
Woohoo.
Wwooww!
God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
"The new Cold War"
Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! 
You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk
Oh God.
Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
Yep.
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
Uh huh.
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
That would be best.
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
Kyle??
And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
Pleeeeease???
No!
Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 
Yeah!
Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
Sure thing, Bebe.
That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. 
Cartman's?
And this is Precious.
Precious?
Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 
Uh huh. 
Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Heheh, yeah.
Mister, please let me out of here.
Now say it again, louder.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!
Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"
Put the lotion in the basket!
Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 
What the hell are you doing?
We're playing "Lambs."
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
Bebe's boobs?
Yes!
So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!
What a stupid bitch! 
It will.
One please.
So? I don't know him!
Dude, relax.
You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! 
Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
I wouldn't worry about that.
So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
You're such a fatass, Cartman.
At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
De bandig baeakhalah?
Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
Oh that's great!
You bet your fat clown ass it is!
Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
...ticket stub?
It was such a long time ago!
Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?
Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called "The Ticking Clock." Works great in the movies. 
GODDAMMIT!!!
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
(Okay.) 
Kenny!!!
His body? Well, why??
Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
Yeah. Closure.
What the fuck is closure?!
Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny. 
You turned him into a teapot?
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 
Wewewewewewe...
Did you get it? 
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
Let him out, Cartman! 
...Kenny?  Kenny?!
I can't see. 
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
It wa a trick!
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 
Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. 
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! 
Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 
Cartman, come on!
What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
How?
Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. 
Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
...No.  Ey! Euuugh.
Cartman? Cartman?!
Wha-uh, what?? What?
Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
Maybe you got brain cancer.
Do you think?
Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
Grandma??
Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
Huh?
Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
What??
You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
HAAHH!!! 
AH! 
(We can watch it at my house.)
In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
What did you say?!
(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
What did you say?!
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
You're too fat to be Kenny.
You're a- stupid Jew.
You see boys, Kenny is in here.  What the???  Wait a minute! This is kitty litter!
Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
Shut up!
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
Shut up!
Bad, Eric, bad! 
That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
Yeah. Good job, fatass! 
I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
Can I help you?
Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.
You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! 
It's gonna be okay, babe.
Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
Damnit! Damnit!  Thanks a lot, kid! 
Eh! 
Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
(Okay!)
You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts
I assure you, I am not high.
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 
What do you mean, fatass?
I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
Where??
I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 
Do you see anything?
Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! 
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
Not by giving me brain damage!
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...
Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?
Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
Yeah, whatever.
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. 
Good job, wizard.
And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
Jews can't be Paladins.
Well, thank you very much, kind heroes.
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. 
Man, that's crap.
Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
Prepare for battle! 
Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
This sounds like a really important quest.
Woww.
This... is so cool.
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 
Lord of the Rings? Ha! That movie's gay!
You're gay!
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
Yeah!
Dude, that video is making people act strange.
The one tape must be returned!  Run! 
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
Precious.  Let me see my precious.  Plee-ee-ee-ease! 
Open.  Bellog. 
Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
Faragon, asshole! 
Clyde's a dick.
Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. 
Kevin, god-damnit..! 
Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 
Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. 
I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. 
My God, this thing must really be powerful. 
You're too young.
Quiet!
You guys, this is stupid.
You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.
We were almost killed.
A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--
We're playing Harry Potter.
Ha!! Fags! 
You guys. Somebody is following us.
It's Butters.
Butters?
Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
What? That's stupid.
I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
Me too. 
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
If that was possible.
Don't let them turn it back into the video store!
We're screwed.
You stupid little fourth graders!
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
Crap! Parents!  Come on, guys.  We'll see you next time, fourthies!
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
Ugh.
Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.
Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. 
No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?
Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...
Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! 
Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
No, it was Kenny!
Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America. 
Ey!
QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. NIGGER. HEEB. FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE. 
Aw man, this is awesome! 
Now you know how it feels.
I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like "All Asians are good at math" is harmful to society.
Look, a covetous Jew!
This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays , because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight,  like this young man here.
Ey!
But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice.
I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! 
You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
I'll take three lunches today, please.
You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!
It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. 
Vhat?  Waht?!
Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
Vhat is in there?
Nothing.
Get back to verk.
Yes sir!  Phew. 
Eww! Eww! Eww! 
Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! 
Not sure. It looks like a possible code five six!
Kenny. Can't have Kenny.
It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.
Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something. 
Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
No, that's Kenny.
What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?
Oh, about a month.
Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
He's gone again.
Weak!
Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.
Uh d'eh'hm quiet, quiet down boys. It doesn't work that way. Uh, okay, I I'm getting ...someone now whose name is g-, a t-. It's an l-, it's a m-, it's k-.
Kenny!
Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
Thanks, asshole.
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours.
Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film.
Oh, good. 
Rob Schneider is a Carrot. Rated PG-13.
Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not funny!
Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
Right now?
Na kamaa karash meh nah- 
Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!
Ahh, Aahhhh! 
Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. Should last a few months in the freezer. 
Hey, ah I feel a lot better.
Well I don't know. How did Edward know my father died in March?
God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
I thought you got it.
It's still in baggage claims!
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
Then you throw it away, smartass. 
Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys.
Who's this asshole?
Wow. That's pretty cool.
Then how does he know our names?
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
Shut up, Cartman!
That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006.
Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! 
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
Yes, come in, please. 
Cartman??
Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
What the hell are you doing here?!
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
Yeah!
Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
How much is this going to cost us?
Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?
Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. 
Poop- poop swatches?
Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?
Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
Well that sounds good.
Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
Hooray!
Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
Yeah.
The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
Yeah.
Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
Yeah!
And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
That's not neato, that sucks.
What?
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
Dude!
Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
No, that's too extreme!
Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
Right. 
Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí? 
¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
¡Sí, sí señor! 
Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
Sí. Marrado. 
Marrado. Spectacularrr.
Sí. 
God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
Boy, it sure is stinky in here!
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?
Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice.
Who the hell are you?
Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future.  I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!
Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
Right on!
Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
Av-a-a-alright, I'm done.
You're done?
Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
Yeah, so how's it look?
It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
What?!
Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 
Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice.
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.
God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.
Jesus Christ!
Hooray!! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!  Christmas Tree!
Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
What are you doing, Cartman?
I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!
You guys, that's it!
What's it?
Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 
Oh no. 
...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
Cartman, why are you doing this?
They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
Mr. Hankey! 
Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!
Really?
Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express!
Wow!
Next stop, the North Pole!
Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
Me neither.
You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!
All the way and back!
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
God, it took forever!
Wow, is that where Santa lives?
I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.
Oh, that's so lame of them. 
Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.
Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
That's what I thought.
And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
Hooray!
Jesus Christ, they killed him!
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
Oh no.
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
What the hell are we supposed to do?! We're like nine inches tall!
Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Oh, Christ.
Here it is. Red Sleigh 2. 
Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
You just have to call out the reindeer's names.
Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
No, no, they're all dead. You have to call out the new ones.  On Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel.  Good luck finding Jesus! 
Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
What are you doing?
I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
Hooowdy ho! 
Jesus!
You're a sick capitalist dog, my main man! 
This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
My children, you should know something.  I'm packing.  Let's go! 
This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
Oh, God-damnit!
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 
Ah, damn it!
What?
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!
Waaaah--  Ow.
Uuugh.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Really? What about?
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
Totally!
What?
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
No I don't remember that!
You don't?
No, because the aliens erased my memory!
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
Aw dude, I hate repeats!
Other than his monstrous size.
SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! 
All right, let's see here.  Oh my God!!
What?
Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle! 
Haha, very funny.
All right, let's take a look. 
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.
Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
Are you okay?
Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 
I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.
Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
You all right?
You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
No way!  You do it, Kenny!
Nope! It has to be Kyle!
Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
God-damnit Cartman!
I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 
Stop it Cartman!
Okay. Okay okay. 
God Dammit!
Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!
(Derrr!)
Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is! 
Eric, that's enough!
Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
Oh, nice going, Cartman!
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
No!
No, go ahead. I'm dry.
It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!
But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
Can I see this thing, please?
Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit! 
Okay. Now it's funny again.
This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
Where is the signal being sent to? 
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
What do we do???
It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! 
What are you doing, man?! 
That ain't no police! 
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
We're in the alien ship.
Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
(Awesome)
This is like my fifth time. 
Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.
Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
How's this? 
Santa!
No.  No! 
Oooo, very nice.
All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take? 
How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! 
You must have some Joozian ancestry.
Tell us about it!
Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??
No.
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers.  Nice meeting you Earthlings. Bye! 
Uuugh.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
What is it, Chef?
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! 
We didn't go to your comedy show.
In the coming days  I will prove to the world  that stem-cell research is a miracle.
Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.
Can too!
Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. 
Oh God-damnit!!
Cartman, just stay out of it.
But they say I can't be in their club!!
Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh. 
Put more clay on the balls.
You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!
What a crime. 
Do you think this is funny?!  Do you think this is funny, huh?!  Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery! 
You can't do that!
I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
You're an art teacher!
(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)
We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
Like what?
Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
TP her house?
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
Oh.
What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh! 
Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
D'you think that's enough?
Should be fine.
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 
Hello boys. Find everything you need?
Yep. All set.
Mokay, let's see here. Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Toilet paper  So, what are you kids up to tonight? 
Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
Okay. Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Tooilet paper  You know, son, I rmember you comin' in last week and buying this much toilet paper. 
Heh yeah, that that's right.
You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
Is this the right house?
It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
So?
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
(Yeah! Fuck you!)
Come on, let's go! 
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
Who cares??
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. 
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 
Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
Damn!
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
Yes, dude!
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? 
Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
Why are they doing us one at a time?
They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
I can get a better deal?
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
No need. I have one for you right here. 
Oh. Okay. Thanks.
Is there anything else I can get for you?
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. 
Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
What about him?
Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
(I think so too.)
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
Butters. 
Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
So what should we do?
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
(Yeah!)
Why not?
Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 
What's this all about, Cartman?
I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
A boat ride?
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
Well, okay.
Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
And you feel like you have to confess.
I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
Cartman!
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
Won't be long, Kyle. 
Cartman, what are you doing?
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
They did?
Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
But can I still kill Kyyyle?
It sure is!
Uh, can we see them-him-her?
You guys, we can't let him do this!
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
Because it was-
Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
I still feel bad, Cartman
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
Yeah. That makes it even worse.
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
I know.
So... so then, how can you feel bad?
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
(Yeah, maybe we should.)
What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
We feel bad for other people.
For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!
What is it, Cartmam? 
It's over this way! Come on!
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
Can't I? 
You, you do? How?
Hi guys.
Cartman??
I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
My consciences just caught up with me.
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
Oh Jesus! 
I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
Hm.
Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
Yeah.  War is not my voice.
Bush is a Naizi
Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?
...Eh the... Founding who? 
SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! 
Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
Maaaa. M-maaaa.
Shut up and study!
Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to have a flashback.
(A what?)
You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
No, you just have to study.
Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
How?!
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
Cartman? Cartman?? 
Benjamin Franklin?
No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
Oh no...
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
Or a really sweet one. 
Your TiVo is full.
Whoa, here it goes! 
Aww crap.
Ohhh awesome!!! 
Worthy young lad, are you all right?
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
This year? Why it's 1776, it is.
Oho yes! I did it I did it!
Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, I am.
Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 
Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?
No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
A flashback? Why, what is that?
Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.
Super neato! 
I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.
But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.
And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress. 
Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
Some favir going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.
It's a bitch, ain't it?
Enter, young messenger.  I am John Hancock, President of the Congress.
Wow.
Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want! 
Whoa, how very very relevant.
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!  Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. 
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
And we will call that country the United States of America.
Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
Wow!
Everyone, stop! Please! 
The-the child! The child, from the hospital.
If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
He does?
I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
Can't be
The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.  Eric Cartman? 
Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
No way.
Miss Lopez, come on out here. 
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Oh, you mean this one? 
There we go, Saright?
That's a very pretty dress. 
Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez
Nono, Jeh-
Jeh-
Jeh
Jennifer Lopez
Hahahahaha, oh my.
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. 
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
Stop it!
Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
I agree. Those places are stupid.
Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
All right all right, here's ten dollars! 
Can we go now, please?!
Yeah, I wanna leave.
Stop it, Cartman!
What?
No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo.
Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. 
What do they want?
S'awright?
What? What?
Hello hello, are you still there?
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!
Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 
There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  "Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!"  "You were wrong, Kyle!"  "Nananananaaana!"  "Hahahahahaaaha!"  "Nananananaaana!" "Hahahahahaaaha!"  Awesommme. Yeeessss.
Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm gonna kill that bitch!!
Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 
...What?
Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
What are you gloating about?
Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.
No!
Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!
Jennifer Lopez?
Who was that?!  You go' a problem?!
Not me!
That? That's what replaced me?!
I'm sure it was just a mistake.
You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!
Nobody
Fuck you! 
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
You'd better stop!
I will
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
Aw, God-dammit!
Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit.
What the hell are you doing?
Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
Sleep!
Sleep!
Moooommm!
What's the matter, sweetie?
Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez.
She's not here right now.
Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?
NO!
I'm not going out in his car.
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.
Jenny, can I kiss you?
NO!
Oh God, Jenny!
OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
You little snot-nose!  You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! 
Aww crap.
You'd better stay away from him! 
OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
I told you this would happen. 
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
EHAGH!  Moooooommmm! 
What is it, sweetie?
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
Good morning, baby.
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
Should we tell him the news?
What news?
It's S'aright?
S'aright.
We're getting married!!
Oh, balls!
Come in.  COME IN!! 
Guys, I need to talk to you.
What's the matter?
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
So stop doing it!
Stop doing what?
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
See?! I just saw your lips move!
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Out! 
Guys... Uh... Uh... 
Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
Yes?  Oh, hello, boys.
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
I'll do that. Have fun, boys. 
Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool.  And later, when I went to get it, it was gone.
My God...
We're on the case.
What have you got, Marsh?
Detective McCormick found something interesting. 
Jesus, we're too late.
Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
His plan was to use a hammer.
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
Then saw off the arms and legs. 
The torso he would dump into the lake. 
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
Looks like the game is over, old man! 
We're in business!
Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington
I lost my dolly.
Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
Put that away, dude! 
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
...Not anymore, you're not!
Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
Ah, I was at home.
Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
How do I do that?
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Stop playing games!
I'm not playing. I really don't know!
That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
How... do you make semen come out?
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
Really?
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
No!
Follow me to the bathroom. 
(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) 
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
My weiner??
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
Well pull harder!
...ow... Ow... It's not workin'
Try doin' it faster
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
NOOooo!
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
Let's go! 
Yeah, that's gay. 
Kyle! 
What?  What??
I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
I don't know.
Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 
Dude, we just can't tell on them.
Why not?
We've got to do something.
Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!
Yeah! This was our hot lead!
No you're not.
Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!
All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!
My dollie! 
We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.
That means you boys are now an official part of the department.
Kewl!
Relax, Hopkins!  All fun and games, right?  Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??
Uh bonus?
Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
Me neither.
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.
Awwwwrrr-auugh. 
Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
Well you should've called Mommy.
Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
Okay. 
Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
Butters?
Yes?
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.
Well, keep tryin', Butters.
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.
Un oh...
These kids are cops, man! 
Bang bang bang... 
(Pakew! Pakew!)
Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!", it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!" 
Certainly.
Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
You did?
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
Wow, dude.
Man, Indians have it good, huh?
Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games.
All right, let's go! 
Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.
I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 
Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
Yeah!
That's right!
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
Oh... 
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
We can stay. And fight.
Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! 
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
What? Tell us?
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
Hey dudes. 
What a dork!
What?
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. 
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
Not as gay as us, though.
Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! 
GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 
You're straight!
You're straight like a freeway!
What the hell is going on??
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. 
...So? I'm half bisexual!
Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
Wow, is that from Origins?
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
Well, what can we do about it?
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
Yeah. Wait, what?
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
He's not our friend. 
Wow, we look great!
Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 
God-damnit!
God dammit! 
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
Christian rock?!
Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
It worked for Creed!
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
You're on, fat boy!
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
What a stupid asshole!
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
Oh, hi Eric.
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
...Ohhh!
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 
What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.
Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 
Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.
I told you, Token.
So, what are we doing?
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
Wow!
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
I'm out. 
Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.
I don't know!
All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
I don't know how to play bass. 
Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 
God-damnit! 
All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.
Almost there, you guys.
Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!
I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
What did you say?! 
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
Cheese!
No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
Cheese!
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
Oh...
Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.
Oh hey guys. How's it going?
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
It is?? 
That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 
Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.
Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.
I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
The Shepherd and the Light, and His Word lifted me up
And I praise His Holy Name wherever I go.
Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
Hey is this the way to the backstage?
Who are you?
Yeah. We proved that Christian music can be tough and hard core.
Yeah, you guys are real hard core.
Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and the Glory!
Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
Always good to be praying before you're playin'.
Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change. Give it up for ... Faith + 1! 
You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest. You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
We just have one question, though. We were looking over some of your lyrics, uh... "I want to walk hand-in-hand with Jesus on a private beach for two./I want him to nibble on my ear and say 'I'm here for you.'" Ih...it seems you really love Christ.
Yes, we sure do.
Eh no but ih it appears you are actually... in love with Christ. 
Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
Well uh of course I do. I mean I just-
Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
Uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for God, and not for the money.
I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
K-tal Records  presents the most inspirational Christian rock band in the world! Faith + 1,  featuring the very best in good, wholesome Christian music.
Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
With great inspirational songs like "I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday,"
Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
The CD is filled with instant classics. Who doesn't remember... 
The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
Cartman, what the hell is all this?
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
But you spent all the money we made!
We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
We like to praise Christ!
Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 
This is the worst day of my life.
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 
Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is please to present you with this Myrrh album. 
Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
No, but you can go double myrrh. 
GOD DAMMIT!! 
Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain.
Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.
OH, FUCK JESUS!! 
Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.
Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!
Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! 
Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. 
Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
Oh My God!! 
With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
I think so.
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
GAAAAAH!!
Calm down! We cannot understand you!
Oh Jesus!
Old people!
Come on! 
Oh God, they're coming! 
In here! 
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
Yeah...
Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!
I believe that's us... thank God. 
And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a "Mongol," not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what  ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course. 
More old people!
Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 
Old people gone mad!
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
We can't fight them, Cartman.
No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
Country Kitchen Buffet?
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
(Woohoo!)
Aw yeah!
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
Well, right, or we could always do that.
Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
(Yeah.)
Who's joking? 
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
You have AIDS?
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
Wow! Casa Bonita?!
What's Casa Bonita?
Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
Who said I'm inviting you? 
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
I have never been a dick to you.
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
Okay, except maybe for that one time.
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
Sorry, my mind's made up.
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
That isn't it, Cartman.
What isn't it?
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
...I don't understand the difference.
I know you don't. 
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?
Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
Like what?
Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
Who's there?
Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, "Ingmar Bergman who?" 
Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
(Yeah!) 
Hey Kyle.
Well?
Well what?
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
Good.
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
What's this all about, Eric?
Butters, can you keep a secret?
Well, sure I can!
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
Nnn-how terrible?
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
What?? 
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
I just see stars. 
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
When do you think uh it'll get here?
I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
What??
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
Oh Jeez!
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
Oh God! Oh Jesus! 
All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
Are you sure?
I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 
Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
Oh. Thanks, dude.
Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
Oh wait. Cartman.
Yes?
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
Okay, boys. Get in the car.
Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
Aw dude, weak.
Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
Yeah, it's kinda weird.
Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
I'll drive you boys. 
Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??
Butters!
Hwaaaah!!
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
What about my parents. Did you see them?
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
Oh my God, let me see!
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. 
What what what?
I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! 
UUuuugh!! 
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
Who's coming this way?
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
Oh God! I hate cannibals!
They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
Noooo!
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
But I can't see nothin'.
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
Are we out in the destruction?
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
Aw man.
All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
Huh... Oh, it's terrible.
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
Whoa!
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
Whaaat??
It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
AAAAHH!
We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
Waaaaaah!
Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
Ooohhhh!
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
Oh no!
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
Uh w-where??
Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
Aren't you coming?
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
"Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?
We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
But... Casa Bonita.
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
But I...  but...  Stand back!
Cartman, stop it!
I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! 
It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
Cartman!
Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 
All right, kid! End of the line!
Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!
Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?
Totally. 
Hey. My name's Gary.
Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!
He's a peckerface, that's what he is!
Go kick his ass, Stan.
Wull, maybe he won't fight.
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
What are they doing?
They're just standing there, talking. 
He's a really nice kid.
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
Hey Stan.
Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
Wow, you made this?
Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be? 
Oh my God...
So what do you guys wanna do?
Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.
Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. 
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
Oh no! You guys broke up?
Oh brother.
Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. 
Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
Dude, this is unbearable.
I'm going to kill myself. 
Woohoo! 
You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 
Aw dude, this is really hard.
Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 
Boys, what are you doing back here?  I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!
Nothing.
What??
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 
D'awww sick! 
Gross dude! 
Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
We're sorry.
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
Hwat??
Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
Alright kids, here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper.  Once you're inside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it?
Got it! 
Yuh your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here!
Isn't he awesome, you guys?
What??
Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
All right boys, just do what I tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars!  As soon as we get into the main facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it?
Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.
Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
This is how we get rid of smokers.  We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!
Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do.
Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow!
Wow, a commercial?
And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go!
God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
Yeah, maybe you're right. 
So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
What are you doing? 
Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the TelePrompTer here. 
Heh, ho-okay. 
Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this.  All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric.
Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic.
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?
That was very good, Eric. Here, eat this cupcake.
Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
But you are. Just eat this one cupcake. It has... sprinkles.
I'm not eating the cupcake.
Eric, do you know what a hero is? A hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. You can be a hero, Eric. All you have to do... is eat the cupcake. 
Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
What are you doing, Cartman?
They're going to kill me! 
Who's going to kill you?
The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
You guys have to help me!
No dude, get away!
Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
If I go, you guys go!
Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
(Uh huh.)
You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups!
I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 
You too, Eric.
Aw awww!
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Right. What are we playing again?
Football.
Got it. 
She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. 
What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
Yeh-heah, right!
God, you're so stupid! 
What a whore! 
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
God, what a fag!
This place is awesome!
How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
So what can I get you?
Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
YMCA...  YMCA-A.
Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.
Dude, Cartman.
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
That's a great idea, Chef.
What?
Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. 
No! No, this can't be happening! 
What?
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
Whoa whoa, Cartman.
It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.
This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man.
We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine. 
Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
All right! We're going to Canada!
Sweet.
I'm trying! 
Look out!
His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.
Which road?!
Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.
Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
Baaaah.
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
It reminds me of death and fear.
How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
Oh no!
How could you be so stupid!
Is it working?
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 
Do you think we can still make it in time?
We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
Ze Prime Minister is inside.
Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
Oh please! Please stop crying.
I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
What is that?
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
Dude, come on.
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
Stop it, Cartman!
Pfaha, so funny. 
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission. 
Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
Kaii yo! 
Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!
(unintelligible)
Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Kick ass! 
No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!
Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 
Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!
Look what we got.
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
But don't tell anybody we have them.
Ugh.
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!
Ho! 
Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
C'mon!
Whoa.
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 
God dammit Cartman!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 
Oh, shit, dude!
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 
Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
Dr. Shafley?
He's really old and going blind.
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
Okay, it's clear. 
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
Quick, hide Butters! 
In here! 
Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! 
No way, you got weapons too?!
At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
Then fight us!
Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
Oh no. Butters!
Butters!
Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
To hell with that!
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
Butters!
Here, Butters!
Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!
Butters!
Here, Butters!
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
Screw you, fatass! 
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
We have to get past them!
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
You have that power too?
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.
What?
What?
You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
Yeah! 
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
What?
Timmy! 
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
...You're an asshole, Cartman.
What? What'd I do?
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Whatever you say. 
You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
What?
Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" 
So?
So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
Oh no. Cartman, no!
It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
That's really, really terrible, dude.
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Why?
Because! 
What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
Okay, then. 
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
God damn you!
You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
What?! 
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
Moooommmm?
Yes, hon? 
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
What's that, hon?
Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 
Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 
...I'll split the money with you. 
...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. 
All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
Awesome.
Okay, next in line please?
Naaaa! Daaaaa!
Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
Naaaa!
Eric Cartman...
Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?
...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
Haaaaaaaaaah!
Enter. 
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
Go on, Kyle.
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
I came here to talk about you!
Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
Top athlete, yeah! '
One thousand dollars, yeah!
Okay, racers, are we ready?  Take your marks.
Daaaa! Daaaa! '
On your marks! Get set! Go! 
Whoa. What the hell?? 
We did it!
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks! 
God-damnit!
Winner, Jimmy Valmer! 
All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!
Ah, screw you hippies!
For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! '
Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '
Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
I'm a Vulcan!
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
No! I'm on the away team too! 
It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Things seem pretty quiet.
Yes. A little too quiet.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
No it doesn't. 
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Oh God, here we go again.
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
He does not!
How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
Naw uh!
Go see the movie, Kyle!
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
People don't hate the Jews!
Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
...You're a stupid asshole! 
Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
Mom! Doorbell!
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 
Mom! Answer the door!
Hey Phillip, guess what?
God damn it, lazy-ass whore. 
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
You were, you were right?
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
You were right. 
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
What?
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Wait a minute. Cartman?! 
Eup. 
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
Oh, that's great, sweetie.
Tell them I'll be down shortly
Okay, hon.
Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives. 
Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
We sure do. 
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 
I'm not sure, but- uh.  Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks. 
Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea.
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening, frieeeeeeends!
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
Good idea!
And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."
What was our Aramaic line again?
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
Oh, this is fun! 
All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Nice.
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! 
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Juden!
Give me my eighteen dollars!
Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo! 
Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 
All right Stan!
Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
(Woohoo!)
Yeah!
That's right!
All right!
You did it, son! You did it!
All right, Butters! 
What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
Whoa...
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
You... you're my robot?
Yes. I will be your new best friend.
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
Really?
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Oh, really?
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
Heh. Wow, that sucks.
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
What?
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
You saw that?
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
Nuh uh.
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
No way.
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
How come?
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
Oh, son of a bitch!
That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
Oh. Yeah.
I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
What?
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
...No way.
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
Weak! 
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
Lame!
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
Where is it? Where is it?!
AWESOM-O?!
Wah!
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
AWESOM-O understands.
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
I would like some Sunny Delight too.
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
AWESOM-O will answers the door. 
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
Why?
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
Why?
Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? 
Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
Weak.
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
Yes, of course. 
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
Suck my balls, Kyle. 
Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
What?
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
Lame.
Hello! It's nice to have you here.
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.
Thank you. 
AWESOM-O?
Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
Argh! 
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
The New Orleans Saints. 
Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Seventeen. 
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
Come on, come on!
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
Haaaa! Haaaa!
Yoe, you okay AWESOM-O?
AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
...What?
Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
AWESOM-O does not understand.
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Lame!
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
Not cool! Totally lame! 
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
Waaaaa! 
Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on. 
Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
Stand by. Be ready to destroy it. 
Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU.
The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
Ah, I'm sorry, robot,  they want me to reprogram you.
I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
What did you say?
I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!
Goddamnit, get me down from here! 
Who made you, robot?
I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!
Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 
Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 
AWESOM-O! 
I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
Hey, robots don't fart!
Uh... now ending fart sequence.
Oh, and it, it smells, too!
Smell sequence initiated.
Hang on a second, here! 
Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!
Wow, kid, you're a little faggot! 
Lame...
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?
No.
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 
Whoa. Dude, no way!
Oh my God, this is awesome! 
He's retired now.
Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. 
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
The Jeffersons?
They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
No way.
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!  Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
Choo-choo train! Yay! 
Let's ride the train! The train! 
Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
Let's ride and ride on the train together
...Train together
On a journey through both of our minds.
...I've got time. Do youuu??
Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.
Choo-choo train.
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden. 
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
No, my parents are.
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
What?
He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
He just showed up here.
Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 
Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight
Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
I think you're awesome too, Cartman. 
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah? 
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 
Think I've got a little more work to do. 
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!
No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
It's ignorant. 
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
Yes?
Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
How about fifteen dollars?
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
Dude, I'm takin' a break.
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
Oh goodness, what happened?
Shoveling accident.
Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back. 
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it.
What?! Who?!
A cheeg- fry?
We can't understand you, asshole! 
We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me.
Look, it's working! 
This is really gay.
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Butters, shut the hell up! 
No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
Ye-heah!
(Yeah, totally awesome!)
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
It is not!
(Giant douche.)
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
You hate Butters.
Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
You misled him, fatass!
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
A turd sandwich.
And the second?
Turd sandwich.
Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?
Turd sandwich.
Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
Awwwww!
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Okay. You win, Kyle.
And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. 
All right turd sandwich!
Cartman? What the hell?!
Giant Douche sucks!
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Game on, Jew-boy!
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
...Okay. I'll vote.
Hello, Clyde.
What do you guys want?
We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
I haven't decided yet.
Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
Sure. 
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
I'm still not totally sure.
Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.
Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
Oh, no! Noooo!!
Now your vote didn't matter.
You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
...What?
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
It's like we're a real town now. 
Whoa, awesome!
My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
You only need one copy, r-tard!
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 
Dude, you can't shop for crap. 
Thanks for coming to Wall-Mart.  All are welcome. All are welcome! 
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
Cartman, stop it!
What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
See?! That sucks, dude!
What? That's called progress, Kyle.
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 
Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord...
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
Oh, awesome! 
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 
Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.
Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Nuh-uh.
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.
I am not, Kyle!
All right, fine. Come on, fatass! 
Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
I heard that!
You heard what?
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
That's not what I said! 
Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!
Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
The heart of Wall-Mart?
Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!
You speak too much, sir!
No, dude, don't! 
That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
I knew you were!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
No, you didn't.
Yes. I did! 
...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 
We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
Oh, no! No!
Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
Yeah.
Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
It's true.
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.
Jews can't be firemen.
Shut up, fatass!
Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
But how do we start a fire?
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
Don't worry, Trent.
Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
My mom is gonna break my legs!
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
Whatever. That's like five years from now.
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
Now, honey, we were trying to read. 
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 
Yeah? And what do we get for it? 
A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 
It'd have to be a good picture, too!  So long, Fourthies!
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
But mom, my teacher will-
Nononono, you gotta go  "But Mo-o-o-om."
But Mo-o-o-
"But Mo-o-o-om."
What else has big round squishy globes? 
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
How do you know?!
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
Oh all right, we'll let this Trent Boyett know that if he messes with you, he's messin' with us!
All right!
(Woohoo!)
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
She won't talk to anybody, boys. Some say... she's just given up hope. 
Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
A picture of your mom's boobs?
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
A lot of stupid things that we regret.
I've been lookin' for you!  Five years I've been waitin' for this day.
Aaaaaaaah!
Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! 
Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBERA STALKER!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANASTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!! 
Stay away from us, Trent!
What is that?
It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
No! They did it! 
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Whatever, that's like five years from now.
Yeah, woohoo!
We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 
Hey, hold on a second!
Uh oh.
I'm taking them to the bushes first!
Hah! Hey!
Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
And I'm Rick Cartman.
The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
And we're... cut! &gt;&gt; /&gt;/&gt;
All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 
Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.
How many students is that?
...Craig's show??
What is that butthole doing now?!
Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay. 
...You're gay!
Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'? 
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle.  Come on!  There you go! 
God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
Go play with yourself, Craig.
(Woohoo!)
Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
"Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!"
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
It should be Sexy News.
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
Nice, Butters, write that down!
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
And panda bears for the preschoolers.
Fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?
We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
Sexy Action School News Team, ho! 
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
Huh?
You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
This is South Park Elementary School closed-circuit television. And now,  Time with the Sexy Action School News! 
Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
Woowhoowoo!
And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
One testicle!  What an asshole! 
Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! 
Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show. 
Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.
But this is real news!
It's boring news, Jimmy.
How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
All right, tell me about it.
Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-
Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
We beat Close-up Animals!
Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
I don't believe it.
I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
How about we have us, um... hmmm.
Thee... uhhh. What if the-?
Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.
Crab people?
They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.
We have crab people. Just sayin'.
How about this one? Calminex?  "Warning: Taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects."
That sounds perfect.
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
I think maybe he's f-feeling it.
Stan, are you getting good ideas?
Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.
Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
Hey! Let's run naked through the street! 
Dude, this TV show is awesome.
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now,  a Sexy Action News Team Special Report: Cough Medicine Abuse in School!  With the Sexy Action School News Team!  It's the report you can't afford to miss!  And now here is Rick Cartman!
They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.
And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically. 
Haha! In your face, Craig!
Nobody has any ideas?
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
Dude, bail?
...I think bail.
See you there, Kev. 
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. 
Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
Yeah? Who invited you?
Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
Kelly who?
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
No! 
Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
What? 
Oh, Goddammit!
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
Do it! Do it!
I'm gonna!
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
Awww, go on and do it already!
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
He's not gonna do it.
And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 
Seasons change, time passes by.
As the weeks become the months become the years.
Eugh... 
Oh my- Doctor!  He's awake! 
Wheh? Where am I?
You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.
Coma... How long?
You're doing so much better, muffin.
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
We'd better get back to the station, sir.
Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
I know it's ridiculous,  but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can!  Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
This is... where the body was found.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
How come the outline is missing its hand?
Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?
Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.
Guess again.
All right, here's a hundred dollars.
Wow!
Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
Cartman, what did you do?!
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
You don't have any powers!
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
He can't do crap!
Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! 
There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric!  We've got a little problem.
What?
We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?
No. Nothing.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
Quiet! He's havin' a vision!
It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  
Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
Yeah!
Proper channels?
You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School. 
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!
Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
Oh, goodness! What's going on?
Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
Enough!  We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court.
In court?
Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying.  The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman,  who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence.
Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.
... 'Kay. Sweet.
Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.
Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 
You are obviously a big fan of my work.
I don't even know you dude!
But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
Oh, Jesus.
And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!  This... is me at the grand canyon.  Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore  Do you see?
Heheh.
Do you see?!
Yes yes, I see! 
Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio.  This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!
AAAAAAAH!
Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park!  Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?!
Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. 
(Hey! Come over here!)
Nope, this isn't our man.  We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. 
(Hey! Help!) 
That's it, no more pictures.  Time to die.
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
Your hand will be one with the others.
Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! 
Hold it right there, killer! 
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle.
You can't hurt me.
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
All right, fine! Forget it! 
What happens to the lion cubs?
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
That's not at all what happens.
All right, fine!
"Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
I know. I deserve it.
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison! 
You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?
He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
You know what? I'm okay. Even though I'm not truly a woman, I think I still like the new me. I'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag.  Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman! Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!
Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
Hippies?
Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
Oh my.
These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything.
Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
Oh, well, so, so what do I do?
Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 
Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high.
God damn hippie! 
Whoa, dude!
Get out of here!
Not cool!  What's up?! 
Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
Ooooo...what's that?
The college know-it-all hippies.
It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names! Open this door right now!
All right, in you go.
Let us out! 
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 
What's wrong with you?!
What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
This is a free country, man!
Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
Just go with it? We've been down here for days!
And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! 
You can't go in there!
Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
Kid, we're have a city council meeting.
Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
A what?
It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. 
Kid, what the hell are you talking about?
I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.
It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
Johnson, get him out of here. 
What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! 
Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! 
I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
NO!
Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 
What the hell are you doing?! 
Everybody get in a single-file line!
There you are!
Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.
What?
I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
Oh no, you're coming downtown! 
No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 
Who was that?
What did I do?!
You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
They're not people, they're HIPPIES!
I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.
Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
I know. I signed the permit.
You... You what?
I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy.
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! 
All right, let's go.
How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!
Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?
Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!
Forget it. 
Please. Don't let them ruin our town.
It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 
Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
It's yours.
I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
Anything else?
Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.
All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! 
You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.
All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
My God...
In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?
We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!
Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
I have to do it, Steven.
All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- 
You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.
Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.
I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 
Godspeed! 
Primary engine running?
Check.
Navigation systems?
Online
Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo, woo! 
Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?
He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing. 
Come on, come on!
Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
...I didn't volunteer!
...All right, fine Chef, go!
We made it, We made it!
Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
Which cord is it?
You're the scientist, jackass!
Nyugh!
Put them in my laptop! 
I'm alive! 
Hold it right there, Kyle! 
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
Token sings?
Of course he sings. He's black.
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.
Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
Probably.
So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 
He's looking at the sign.
Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
All right.
Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
It's genius.
Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
Nothin'
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
This will only take a second.
Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?" Right?
...Yeah?
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
Can I talk to you?! 
I'll I'll call you back, Abe. 
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm making it look like important people call us.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
...well Token doesn't know that.
Yes he does!
How?!
Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
Jew! 
You guys, we're gonna lose our client. 
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?
Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. 
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 
(Hey, terrific!)
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
We knew you could do it!
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
(All right!)
Sweet!
Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh my God! Okay!
Token, you signed with us!
Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
...Oooo...
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?  Do you like steak, Token? I know a great place for you locally. 
...Goddamnit! 
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 
Aww, that's too bad. She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres, but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant. 
You've ...already done all the work?
Rearry?
We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. 
Jesus, we made it just in time! 
Excuse us!
Oh crap!
Dude, how long is the wait?
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
Aw, just forget it! 
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
Stupid assholes! 
Really?
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!
Come on, Wing!
Oh my God, dude!
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
Awww! 
Gay.
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Your gift of hope is a great deduction. 
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes.
Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. 
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
Four thousand dollars? 
Get out!
That's four hundred for us! We did it! 
Yeah!
Who let the dogs out?
Who? Who? Who who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who? Who? Who who?
Who let-?
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
Naw, sh-she was with you!
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Wing? Wing?
Wing?
Wing? Here, Wing!
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
"It's just four little boys" 
Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
Cartman! 
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 
Enough!  I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Me too.
Aw aw guys, come on!
Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.
Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 
Sing, sing a song.
Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!
Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.
Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 
Sweetie, can't we go after school?
Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!
Kenny, when did you get here?
(Friday)
Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 
Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?
Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!
Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!
Wuh what'd I do?
JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!
That's... really touching.
(looking bored) Fags!
To Eric Cartman: "Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP."
Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
I don't know. I lost the last page.
Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours.
Yes!
He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain.
Well... well then he's NOT alive.
He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...
That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.
Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
He did? When?
Um, it was um, this one time...
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
He did not!
Did so!
Did not!
Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! 
Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime  we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible.  Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back.
You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here.
I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
Best friends forever?
That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
What?
He's right in here.
We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority.
That's right. Respect our authoritah.
We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 
Kenny! Kenny!
Tomato!
Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the last page of Kenny's will. 
What?
That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0.
We're done! No more baseball!
We can start having fun again! 
All right, we did it! 
Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
Post-season?
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 
All right, hit one out of the park!
Damnit!
Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
Ball!
All right! 
Aw, Jesus! 
Ball. Balll. 
No!
That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
Ball four!
What?!
Walk to first! Woo!
Aw Goddamnit! 
Strike three!
How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!
We're so proud of you kids!
What happens if we win the State Championship game?
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!
I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
Wow, he IS great at sucking.
We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
She's here!
She's got Colonel!
I want some!
Oh boy!
I want a breast!
Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?
It won't take a minute.
Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
The skin's the best part...
Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. 
That sounds great!
Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 
I think I have extra.
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
Thanks. 
Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!
Ohoho, nhn.
No! No!!
Aww, that's tragic.
Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 
I never realized ignoring him was an option.
Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
Hey Eric! 
...What did you say?
Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"
Butters...  Butters! You can see me??
Well, sure I can see you.
Oh my God, and you can hear me??
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
Because, Butters, I'm... dead. 
You died?? How??
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
Butters...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
Butters, you have to help me!
Go away! You aren't real!
All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 
Y yes, yes sir. 
Butters.
AH- 
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
But I don't want to see you!
Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
What do you mean?
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
Oh.
Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.
This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! 
Oh, what is it?
Tell her, tell her that I love her.
Oh, that's so nice.
Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
Just the good times.
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
I can't! Don't you understand?!
He can't! Don't you understand?!
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
Aww, that's okay, Eric.
Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
So I won't see you again?
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
Wow.
G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 
Yeh you're still here.
Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
What else do I have to do?!
Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
Atone?
Did you ever do anything really bad?
Not really...
Broke fence...
I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
Really?
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
I know how.
I'm gonna make, make it right.
I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.
Make, make it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
It feels so good to be making up
For all the things I've done wrong.
I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven
Wanted from me all along.
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.
'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.
Not faking it, I'm making it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
Make, make it right!
Make, make it right!
Gonna make it right, girl, I've got to have your lovin' tonight!
Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
Does this mean... you have to go now?
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?
Ahhh. 
Butters.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
She's gonna close soon! Come on! 
Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
I told you, Butters. 
Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash.
Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
Don't worry. I have a plan. 
Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.
They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. 
I have no idea.
Yes, it's working! 
Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes.
Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
Boy, we sure did.
My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too, ghost pal.
Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 
Yeah. S-see ya, Eric. 
You sonofabitch Butters!
Huh?
You told me I was a ghost!
Huh but I thought you were one!
How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! 
He's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here?
Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
It's occupied. 
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. 
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
Up yours, Butters.
Jerk! 
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?
Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
Well, wha-what do I do?
I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.
Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
Hi Jimmy.
Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.
You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her.
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, "No WAY do I want it now!" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-
All right, when she stops yappin' again, say "Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."
It's like I told Debbie: "If you're gonna go out with my friends-"
All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful."
Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.
Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
Creep! 
Aaagh!
And now we have Eric Cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, Scarface. 
D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say "That's the bad guy!" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
You know how?
Sure I do!
Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.
Okay, turn on the ignition,
Awesome.
Okay... 
We're not moving.
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
Jesus Christ!!!
Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! 
Oh dude! Oh Jesus!
Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
What?
Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! 
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 
Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
Yeah.
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
Well they should've gotten out of there!
Maybe they couldn't get out!
We did!
Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
Nothing
Hngh, totally.
Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
Aw crap!
Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
How?
Why?
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."
Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!
Help! Help! 
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
Not so fast, Kyle.
What are you doing?
Hand over the gold!
What gold??
You know what I'm talkng about!
No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
I want... your Jew gold! 
...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!
Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
...Aw man.
I broke the dam.
Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
Yeah, us too.
Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
What?
What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.
YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!
Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
Okay. I'm not lookin'. 
Video playback initialized. 
I... don't believe it.
Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.
Good man. Any luck here?
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
Let's go take it!
Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
So what do you suggest?
Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.
Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?
No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
Oh uh, hi Mom.
Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. 
N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. 
No, wait. What... what's he doing? 
Okay. One! Two! 
NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!
Nice.
Oh... Thank you. 
Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 
That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
Dude, they totally think he's a girl. 
Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.
Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 
You're gonna be fine.
Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
Good luck, man. 
Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.
Jesus, what are they doing in there?
God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
He's just dancing around.
That son of a bitch!
My mom?  Hello?
Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
Well, I'm workin' on it.
Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 
He got it! He got the device! 
Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! 
What the hell?
Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 
It isn't right! Make it go away!
Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. 
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
How come you get to use it first?
Because I do, Clyde.
I wanna use it.
I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
Nah dude, then it won't be fun tow watch.
Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
You mean destroy it?
Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
Think of the power!
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
Damn, Ken.
Damnit, damnit! Stan and Kyle's egg is still doin' fine! Those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan!  Yes, what?!  What the hell is this?!
I broke the egg.
You broke your egg?? Uh but you're partnered with a girl.
I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
Did you tell anyone else about this?
...No.
Did you tell your egg partner, Heidi?
No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
I can't do that, Eric!
Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
You have to get an A, Eric. Here: I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right?  Just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... There we go, good as new.  Go enjoy the rest of your recess.
Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
...Okay, well, you're welcome, Eric. Now, just run along. 
...Why are you doing this?
Because I'm a nice teacher, all right?
What do you want from me?
Nothing! It's all okay! Just take your damn egg!
...No.
Eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! You're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?!
Yes teacher.
Okay, very nice, Token. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have ah Eric.
Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles."  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
What?!
Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." 
This is all a bunch of crap!
Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
Fine, I will! 
Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 
Thanks Butters
Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! 
Eric honey, time to get up for school. 
-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-
Poopsiekins!  Sweetie, what is the-  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
I'M GINGER!
Oh my God! Eric!
Help me! Hellp mee!
Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.
And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.
So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
Oh... 
Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!
All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy.
Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?
Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
You mean,you're a ginger?
Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
Is that an umbrella you're using?
Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
What do you mean, Kyle?
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. 
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? 
What are you doing?
I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
Huh?
You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
But... it's me.
Dude, check it out. 
Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
Yeah!
Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.
...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...
Ron Howard?
Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
Ron Howard? 
Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
Yeah!
Red Power! 
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
Yeah!
Red Power!
Red Power!
Red Power!
I don't believe it.
Red Power!
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
Red Power!
Red Power!
Better red than dead!
Better red than dead!
Better red than dead!
Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of "Annie" has just premiered to cries of outrage.  A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie  is being played by a girl  who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman.
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?
The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
Yeah! That's right! 
There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!
Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference!  Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!
Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?
Red Power!
Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
Yeah!!
Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 
Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need. 
We're fine, thanks.
Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee?
We're fine!
Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference.
You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
Ex-terminate?
Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
Oh Jesus, I should have known!
What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! 
You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items?
No, we're fine! Thank you!
How about lava? You got enough lava?
Yes! We're good!
Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys.
You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!
Cartman! I need to tell you something!
Go on then! Say your last words!
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what? 
Yeah!
Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?
Huh? What?
D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.
Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.
See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 
What did that kid in the green hat tell you?
... Huh?
That kid right there. What did he just tell you?
Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you?
No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.
Ginger or not, it's all the same.
That's it! You've got it!
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame. 
Hand in hand, we can live together.
Live together!
We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
The same, you and I!
You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
HA! Saving money, duhhh! 
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
Well I can't spend any money.
Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 
Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 
And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave! 
I'm all wet! Sweet!
Now get ready for Jambu's next trick. 
Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly's gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks.  When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command.  Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready!  That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose!  I wish Kelly would ride on my nose. 
Yes! Yeehehehes! 
Okay, where to next?
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
Why?
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
Killer. 
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by.
Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
Goddammit, say something!
Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die.
You live on the moon?
They want twenty million dollars.
Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.
Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
Which highway did they take??
Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
We have to hurry!
All right, out of the truck!
Uh oh.
Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
Oh crap! There's more of them! 
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. 
Ichi!
Ichi banzai
Ichi!
Ichi banzai! Kya!
Karutamane-san! What are you doing?!
I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.
Eriku-san, you must follow direction! You raku disciprine!
Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!
Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
Yeah, let's go.
Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 
Dude, what the hell is he doing?
This is sooo embarrassing.
You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
Man, that was such a bummer.
Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
Why?
Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
All right, Stan. Sure.
