You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
Going away? For how long?
Good-bye! ..
Draw two card, fatass.
He's back!
Yeah!
All right! 
Chef! I can't believe you're back!
Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
Like what?
I gotta- I gotta go. 
Weirdo. 
How's it goin'?
Good.
Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
...Chef?? A-are you okay?
Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.
This doesn't make any sense!
Did Chef ever try one of these on for size? 
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
Hello there, children!
Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
(Like what?)
Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
Yeah!
All right, come on guys!
May I help you.
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
Indeed!
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
Yes, what else would we do?
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club!  Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit.
...Dude!
No! 
Dude, what are you doing?!
Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody.  Well, so long then.
Just what the hell is that thing?!
What? What thing? I don't see anything.
HA! I knew it!
Knew what?
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
Mr. Chef, is it?
All right, come on. 
Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
Would you like to daaance???
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
Come on, Chef! You can do it!
He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. 
...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see!  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?
We're not going anywhere without Chef.
All right, come on kids.
No! Hey!
This is their house and they don't want you here. 
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills. 
Chef, come on!
I can't... break these locks. 
Here! 
What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!
Get outside! 
You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
I'm sorry children. 
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
All right, this! 
CHEF! 
Oh my God... They killed Chef.
You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!
Come on, let's go. 
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
He's right. 
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
Thanks.
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
What?!
Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
Dad, can we go home, please?
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
But Dad, I want-
Oh hey Kyle.
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 
Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!
Dad, let's just go!
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
Yes, it certainly is.
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
Take offense.
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 
Alienated.
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
Well, I totally agree, Kyle.
You do??
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
Righ!  Okay, good.
And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!
What??
Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. 
So... what do you do for fun?
Do you want some acid?
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
Everything okay in here, Kyle?
Yeah, fine, Dad.
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!
The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.
Kyle!
Hey Stan.
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 
NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
Yeah!
Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
Yeah, I guess so.
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
I have no idea!
They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
Dude, it's a good show.
Love will keep us together
Hehaha, heh.
Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh.
That's it? That's all they did?
What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
Uhhh...
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 
Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
Dad? Are you sure there's time?
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
No!
Ike! 
Ike? Iiike!  Ike! 
Ice cream. I want chocolate.
Ike!  This way!  Iiike! 
Kyyyle!
Nooooo! 
Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
You know we might not even make it into the studio.
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
So what made you change your mind?
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
Yeah! 
Are you set?
I'm set! Let's do this!
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
What are you talking about?!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
What?  CARTMAN! 
Holy Crap! 
Ahhh!
Who are those people?
No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 
Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
You just want Family Guy off the air...
So long, Kyle!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
Eat my shorts!
What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 
You one of them?
Who?
I I said "thank you." Thank you for listening. 
Thanks a lot for the ride.
Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!
I'll do everything I can.
I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I like that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know? 
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
Who wants to know?!
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
The network president's office is in there! 
Oh thanks, dude.
No problem, man. 
Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!
Son of a bitch.
Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
Well well well! 
Cartman!
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
You fat sun of a bitch!
Yeah.
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
Cool man!
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
WHAT?!
Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!
How the hell did you get out?
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!
You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
I can't let you do that!
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
Ow. Quit it!
Stop it!
Ow. Quit it!
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
No more timeouts, fatass!
Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 
Thanks, kid.
President approval code  0-0-destruct-
Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!
Who are you?
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid?
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
What manatees??!! 
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
Okay, I'll listen to you.  Julie?
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
But he has a gun.
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
Do the right thing, Mr. President.
How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
No gay speeches, Kyle!
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
Five seconds, Mr. President! 
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
Yes! 
M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?
Dick Cheney?
Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  ManBearPig. 
ManBearPig? 
Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.
Just play the game, fatass!
All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
FOOD!  Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore.
We know. 
It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
Okay, Mr. Marsh. 
ManBearPig?
He's half man and half bearpig
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
That doesn't make any sense.
Oh my God!  ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! 
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
Ah I don't think so, dude. 
Yeah, we've got school anyway.
All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.
What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
Kids! Kids, over here! Look.
What?
Wait! Shhh.  Christ! He's here! Take this rope!  Be ready to tie him up!  I've got you now, you son of a bitch! 
What are you doing?! 
O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now!  Go! Go! Go out, now! 
Hello?
Help!
We're trapped in here!
Somebody get us some help down hyah!
Hello, help!
Help!
Forget it! They can't hear us!
(Oh, no kidding.)
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 
You see anything, Kenny??
(No, nothing!) 
Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??
No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.
Cartman, you okay??  You need help??
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 
It looks like we're completely sealed in.
There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
Maybe we should go for it.
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
Why?
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
Aw, dude! 
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
C-Cartman?
Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
Dude, what are you doing?
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
Dude, get away from me!
Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put.
Stan! Stan, wake up!
Huh? What? Have they come for us?
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 
I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.
We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
Come on come on! Pull!
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 
What the hell is that??
Yes you do! 
What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
Ruuun! 
Grab my hand.
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
I can't kick!
Yes you can!
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
I need your help!
Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser. 
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 
Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?
Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
You'er not staying at my house either.
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
NO, Cartman!
Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
We're over here, by the cart. 
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
Heheh, totally, heheh.
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
See where I am? It's this way. 
Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
Oh crap! It's that guy again! 
Who is this?
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
You bastard! 
That sonofabitch!
Who is that guy?
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
Everyone hold! 
He's targeting us.
I have poop on my pants.
Ike, look out! 
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
Boars?
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
Llive to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyesLive to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall&lt;p&gt;Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winLive to winLive to winYeah, win 
Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
I'm in.
Me too.
Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
'K.
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
All right, everyone ready?
Ready.
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
What's the autolocate macro?
Command-0. 
Okay, right behind Stan.
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.
Christ...
Cast on him again.
Kyle! Fire spell!
Aaaa...  AH! Huh?! 
Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! 
Kyle, you have to keep playing.
I can't. Just leave me behind.
Kyle, cast arcane missile!
I'm out of mana, I told you.
His shield and armor spells are down!
Attack! 
Yeah.
Yeah yeah.
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
That was such über pwnage
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
Oh yeah.
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Not yet.
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
Will you shut up about 9/11!
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
Yeah, at least one-fourth.
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
Aha! Do you see?
Where did you hear that?
I rest my case.
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
That's right, Butters.
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
Oh no...
For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
Oh Christ...
So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
Me??!
Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 
Waaaah! 
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!
Hello bubbe, how was school today?
Terrible.
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
Kyle!
Aaaah!
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
Well why did you have to involve me??
It's not my fault.
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
Really?
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
......Dude.
Aw geez. Come on in, kids.  It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.
They are?
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
...That's retarded.
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
Code 234
What is it?
Anthrax?!
Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know...
Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.
Come on in, Mr. President. 
Uh, Mr. President, my name is-
SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything!  We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!
Really?
Some pigs never learn.
No. Way.
Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.
...Really??
Beauutiful money, hahahaha!
...Really??
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
It just... doesn't seem right.
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here! 
Ogh!
Dude! What the hell is going on?!
What who said?
Dude, we aren't going to kill you. 
It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!
Who the fuck are you?!
There's no time! come on! 
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed.
You f-figured this thing all out?
Aw Jesus...
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
That's quite enough, Hardly!  Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11.  It's all right here in these secret documents,  but you'll never get them. 
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing.
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
Stan! What the fuck?!
It was all planned out!
You knew this whole time? Why?
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
What??
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
So you blamed the government?!
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
Yuh.
So then, who was responsible for 9/11?
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
Huh?
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
What's he doing at his teacher's house?
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 
OOOH! 
Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??
Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught.  Hold on, please, you don't understand.
Really?! What's there not to understand?!
Your brother and I... are in love.
He's a little young, don't you think?!
He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 
Nonono, nononono.
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
No, no.
Ike?
Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?
This is nuts.
Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
That's great.
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
Mommy loves you too, sweetie.
Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice.
Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
Oh? What's the crime?
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
A woman.
Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. 
Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
The blonde?
Yeah.
Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?
Yes.
Nnice.
What?! No, you don't understand-
You sure they've had sex?
Yeah.
Has she performed oral sex on him?
I think so.
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. 
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his "Luckiest Boy In America" medal right away. 
Gargh!
Sure dude.
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
Dude, what's the matter?
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
"stick it inside her and pee"
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
They what??
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
Well they're doing it!
But... she's hot.
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 
Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
You are dead to me!
What?
I said, you're dead to me!
I'm dead to you?
Oh no!
What?
Get your things together. We don't have much time.
Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike! 
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
How do you know that?
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
Who's Beth?
Ehthat was pretty good.
Can we get going now, please?!
Open up! I'm with the Dawg! 
Oh crap! 
You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
No! Ike, don't do it!
I don deser futty bad man.
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 
You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
Yaaaay!
Ike!
Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
I am doing it.
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 
Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
I've done it lots of times.
Prove it!
Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
You're afraid to do it, too.
I'm a geologist! 
He's right. It's just a spook story.
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
Oh no! YOU summoned my spirit, YOU're gettin' me all the way to the party! As long as I get to the party in time to party, everything'll be all right.  Hey! 
...Smalls. 
It does work!!
Holy crap!!
Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes.
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
Oh God...  Okay, how long now?
Will you shut up already?! 
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
No.
It's simple science, Kyle.
You'll die, retard!
Dude, no way.
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
Kill the table-eaters! In the name of Almighty Science! 
Hello? 
Hello? Kyle?
Hello?
Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?
What do you want?!
Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It it backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future.
... Uh huh.
Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.
... I'm hanging up now.
No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.
Suck my balls, fatass.
... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle. 
Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 
Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!
You got it, Stan!
Yeah!
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
Yeah!
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
No he's not.  Is he?
I don't know.
All right, Eric, come on, Eric.
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
What was his point?
I have no idea.
Dude, I don't get it.
I don't get it either.
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
...Huh?
This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual".  This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
Is this all you brought us here to see?
Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
Butters is staying over tonight?
Come on, let's go. 
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
Yeah Kyle?
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
Uh what do you mean?
I mean, that if-
Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
Hrrugh! 
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
Dude!
Because that makes Butters gay now!
No dude, that makes you gay!
Eh- ...what?
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
Nuh uh.
Yeah huh!
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
You can't!
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
How?
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
Really?
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
...Idiot.
Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
What are you talking about, fatass?
I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
You figured that out, huh?
That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
Except for us.
Right, except for you.
And all the people we tell.
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Like what?
Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
Okay, my turn. 
Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
Where's what?
You know God damned well what!
Let go of me.
I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
Give it back, Kyle!
I don't have it!
I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
Shut up!
Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell.  Who'd like to go first? 
Ow! Quit it, dude!
HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
He isn't actually going to show everyone...
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
Me?!
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
It was him. It had to have been him!
All right, lock that door, Craig! 
What's this about, Cartman? 
Ur ur re- ur really?
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
This is a scientific test, designed to-
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
Yeah. Me neither.
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
It doesn't prove anything!
Kenny!
No way.
Wait, wait!
Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
He had cooties and he lied about it!
Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
What?
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
Now you go, Baahir. 
Yeah?
Kyle, are you on your computer?
What? No, I'm sick. 
Get online. I need you to check something for me.
Dude, leave me alone.
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
What? Why?
Get online now!
All right, all right. 
Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
Over a hundred.
Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
White Stripes
That's funny.
What?
Well all right! 
Dude. 
Yeah. 
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
I guess so.
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
Wuh what doesn't follow?
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
Okay.
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
Yeah. Actually, there is.
What?
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
So then maybe you're wrong.
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
Yeah.  What is that?
It's my balls! 
God damn it Cartman!
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
Russian?
Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
Oh that's a good idea. 
Are we just gonna let this go on? 
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. 
Hey.
Donner, take over that station. 
What's going on?
This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
...Homeland Security?
All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
We just read it on Drudge Report.
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
...Not anymore you're not.
Hoh my!
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!
All right! MapQuest the address!
I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.
Good thinking
Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
...Maybe. 
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
...That is so missing the point.
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
Yes or no, Kyle?!
No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
Help.
What happened?
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
You...
Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
What is it in regard to? 
The history of Easter.
Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others.
It kind of looks like... an egg.
Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter.
Who is Saint Peter?
Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. 
Peter Rabbit.
Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.
I don't see it.
Look more closelier.  With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it.  That... is Saint Peter.  The original Pope of Christianity.
I don't believe it.
Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.
So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
PEEEEPS! 
So what now?
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone!
You swore on the cross, fatso!
We'll never get out in time to stop him!
Don't you have any superpowers?
Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.
What?
Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
N-no way! Do it yourself.
Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
Don't make me do this.
My son, there is no time! Do it!
Eric Cartman can never know about this.
I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.
Happy Easter, Jesus. 
Awgh! 
...Jesus?
Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it!  Stupid ass man! They're all the same! 
Oh God, here we go again.
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
Our whole weekend is shot.
Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
Sí, sí.
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
Have what?
You said you all wrote essays.
(Uh oh...)
Dude, we're totally fucked now!
We thought it was kind of strange.
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
Son of a bitch! 
No, I got it done. 
Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
Crap! 
We're dead.
Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.
Really?
These guys are pretty good.
Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
Fine.
Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
Really?
He won't make it.
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
That was a sweet idea, Kyle. 
God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.
Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
Got any more?
No, that... I thought that was a lot.
Spare any change?
You're welcome. 
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
I don't know.
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
He did?
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
You what?!
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
I don't want you to jump them, retard!
Dude, it's our dads.
Oh my God.
Aaahhh! 
Holy shit, dude! 
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
You barely made it over one, fatass!
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
Chaaaaange?
What's it doing?
Oh my God, they're coming in!  Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!
What about you?
You homeless or homeowners?
We're nine.
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
Shut up, Cartman!
Thirty was hard enough.
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. 
You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
What?
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
(What are you gonna do?)
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
What are they doing?  Don't leave us!
All right, hit it.
In the city
City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless
Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
Good morning, Eric. 
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
What?
It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
He's faking.
Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
Who cares about saying whatever you-?
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
Grrhh, whatever. 
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
Will you knock it off already?!
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
Don't push me, asshole!
Hello Mrs. Garrison-  Ass. ASS.  I want to help your class better understand this illness.  Piss!
No! Up yours, fatboy!
Kyle please! I'm sorry!
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
Faking?  You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.
Dude...
Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so.
Aw, come on!
So then you apologize for what you said before?
Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Well Kyle?
I'm sorry.
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
I'm sorry.
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
...Scotch?
Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
Then the game is on, Kyle.
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." 
What did you say?
Uhh nuh-nothing...
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like "I touched penises with my cousin!"  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!
You sure you don't wanna back out?
Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
Kyle?
Surprise, fatass!
Kyle, what are you doing?
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
What?
I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
No, I- I beat you!
All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
This is fucking retarded!
Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.
Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Kyle, suck my balls. 
Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
From Ireland.
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
I thought I did. 
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
I'm not doing it, fatass!
We had a deal, Kyle!
Just get out of here!
You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
What was the agreement?
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
Hey dudes. 
Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?
How was what?
Sucking Cartman's b-balls.
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine? 
Dude.
All aboard the Imagination Balloon! 
Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong
.
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
AAAAAH!
STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 
Dude! 
Goodbye Butters.
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
Hello?
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
Yeah! How'd you know?
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
Our darling Butters never came home last night.
What did they say??
We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.
...Dude...
Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?
I...
Is this not your signature on the contract?
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
Dude, do you really have to do it?
Let's just get this over with!
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
God damnit!
You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.
Who are you?
ALLAH!!! 
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
We just... went on a balloon ride.
It was the Chinese, wasn't it?
...What?
Ohh, I'm sorry sir.
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination.
Ah I guess.
What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-
No, no dude, it went up there.
Imagina-he-hey-
Imagina-eh
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
Right, then it was "Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on" 
Sector Two?? 
Cartman??
Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.
Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.
Stan?
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
Just get to it already!
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
Let's just DO IT! 
Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
AAAHHH! 
KYLE!! 
AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
Hello?  Hello? Anybody? 
Stan? 
Hello?
Stan?
Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
Cartman, what's happened?
What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
Arh!
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
That's right, Steven, yeah.
Oh for the love of God!
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
Stan! Dude, is that you?
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
...Oh that makes sense.
Dude, what's happening?
Thank you.
Oh no.
Kyle? What's happening?
The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
What?! You can't let them do that!
What am I supposed to do?
Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
Stan? Stan?? 
Where are you going?!
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 
We had a DEAL KYLE!
Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
This area is restricted, little boy.
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo! 
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Kyle? Kyle, what happened?
Nothing.
What??
Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
Well you have to convince them they are real!
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
Huh? 
Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.
Oh boy...
What seems to be the problem, my child?
Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.
Aah.
Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Kyle, this is Superman.
Hi Superman.
I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.
I know.
You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.
Oh God...
The hell are you doing back here?!
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
You have to stop!
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?
Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
Cartman, don't!
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
So you boys like this music, huh?
Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 
No way!
For reals? 
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
Oh my God!
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
Do we? He's a legend!
That, would be impressive.
Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
All right, nice rehearsal, boys.
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. 
Oh, okay. Cool. 
Wow wee, look at him go!
Hey dude, how'd it-? 
Uh ohhh.
Who is this?
Sup?
Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
But it's our game. We bought it together.
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
I have been sick!
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!
I'm not done yet.
Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?
No. You're thinking of somebody else.
How come you're playing here now?
Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.
Thanks, Mick.
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
What are you doing here? 
Please, ih ih, it won't take long.
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
That isn't it at all. 
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
What, you mean it?
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
Then let's go, dude! 
Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?
Thanks, Mick! 
That's it?
Goddammit! God dammit! 
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
(Woohoo!) 
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
You're last, dude! 
No way.
So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
I'm last? Last?
Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 
Oh God! I do?
But he has his mother's nose.
Ahahah!
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
Hrrgh! 
Hey.
Hello. 
I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
Yeah.
Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
We're not?
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
Hey yeah.
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
Sunshine.
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
Do not burn down the school, Kyle. 
Who said that?
I did.  Do you know who I am?
Abraham Lincoln?
Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
You must be patient.
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?
That should just about do it.
He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.
All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
Kyle! Kyle, don't!
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
The list was a forgery, Kyle!
Huh??
That's about far enough!  Give me that list, Wendy!
Stan, what is going on?!
Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
So what number was I??
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 
She's gonna kill us?
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.
Cartman has HIV?
We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-
Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say "Hi", m'kay? 
...No. Way.
God damn it, this sucks ass!
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
No you don't!
I do. 
If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
Wagh.
Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?
What? No?!
We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
What?
Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
What did he do?
Why do I have HIV?!
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
What did you do?!
Nothing!
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
AAAAAAA! 
Kyle!
Here you go!  Here you go! 
All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
He gave me AIDS!
What?
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
I'm sorry.
An apology?!
That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
...What?!
Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
I'm going to break everything that you own! 
Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
There is no cure, you asshole!
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
What hope?!
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
You're lying!
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
Magic Johnson?
He was a basketball player.
So what?!
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
Oh, you boys are  like that, huh?
NO!
No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
Don't. Touch me.
Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. 
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
Kyle, we need to try to find a-
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
Are you sure?
Yes!!
Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. 
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
The pool is over there , where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen  is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all.
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. 
Dude.
Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.
You sleep with money. Every night?
Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure.
Wugh.
I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman.  Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds , these two brave friends-
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado , who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars.
A hundred thousand dollars?
...and spearchuckers.
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
And she's at a hotel in our town. 
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
Hokay. 
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
Oh no.
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.
We uh, we have special permission?
My boys? Really? Send them in.  It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. 
We did it guys!
Yehehahah, all right!
Ahall right!
You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
She's... alive.
Whew.
But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. 
Oh my God!
The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney.  Right, boys?!
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
Oh, God, what have we done?!
No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.
Dude! 
There she is! 
Oh crap! 
That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.
What?!
All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! 
Aw come on now, people! 
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
Yes they are! I have an idea.
Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!
I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
She must be back at the train station; come on! 
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die.
Huh? 
Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?
NO!
Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
All right, everyone's about here.
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on! 
Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.
Corn harvest!
M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it "The Choking Game", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
You can get high from choking yourself? 
All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
You guys are wasting your time.
(Ow.)
Whoa! 
Ah, Kenny! 
Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
(I almost... touched them.)
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
Guys, have you seen Kenny?
Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
Yeah, who has cats these days? 
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)
Kenny? 
(Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) 
Kenny!
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
We've gotta keep this away from him.
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
Yeah?
Kyle, have you been getting high?!
No.
Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
How long have you been on the cheese?!
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
Now, Kyle!
God! 
Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
What?
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! 
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
What the hell is he talking about?
I have no idea.
But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 
Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
Kenny! 
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
Kenny? Kenny?!
Oh really? Goodie! 
Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
We don't care. *urp*
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later!  Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this.  Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA.
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
Oh you do, huh?!  They've had enough. They want us to end the strike.  Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this.  All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!
We totally think you should have more money.
Wwe got 'em! We did it!  All right, how much are you gonna give us?
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!
The Internet?
What'd they say?
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
This is going great!
Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! 
Excuse me.  Hello?
You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.
Wait we're working on it.
You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already.  You've got me over a barrel and you know it!
Sir, we're doing everything we can.
You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood!  Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die.
We don't want you to die.
Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. 
We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
Haw!
Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
What?! You mean it?! 
Okay, we did it.
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
...You are a homo, Butters.
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. 
Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
Excuse me?
He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. 
Ike. Ike!  It's over.
It's over?
Yeah. Here you go. 
Me too!
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
You're not the teacher, fatass.
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
You're not an awesome teacher!
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
Kenny's!
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis? 
What?
Kyle, I need to use your Internet
Ih it's not working.
What?!
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!
I have to get online before school.
Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
It's not working here?
We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
Where... is... the Internet?
All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! 
Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
What is it, Kyle?
I think... I know what's wrong.
Ughh.
This is gonna suck.
Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?
That guy is wearing a digital watch.
What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864.
Right. Except for it really isn't.
Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. 
What's that?
What?!
Come on, this is serious!
Over here. This looks like an office.
Here! Here's the phone! 
I can't get a dial tone. 
What's the number to dial out?
I'll say.
I got through. Hello, police?
Nine one one, what's your emergency?
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
Taken hostage where?
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
Sister, you don't know the half of it.
Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan.  I'd like to speak with the chief of police!  Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!
Why aren't the cops coming in?
Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
Will you shut up!
God damn it you people are fucking insane!
I don't believe it.
God damn it!
Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
Stan?
All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
How?
I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
Yeah,  fuck 'em.
No... No!  No...
Let's get out of here!
We can't just leave!
Come on!
Aw it's horrible! 
Oh God!
Somebody do something!
Why are they doing this?!
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
COME ON LET'S GO! 
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
Let's just go, Let's just go! 
NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
You aren't alone. 
Stan?
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
I love you too.
You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
Did you see it?
I don't know what I saw!  All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-
Indy deserved more than that!
But they raped Indiana Jones!
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
Hawwww! Hawwww! 
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
Boys, we got 'em.
What?
What do we do?
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
That's not true. You're just saying that.
No, really. We've always thought you suck.
If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
Girls like shaved balls?
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
I think Kenny likes it. 
Over two hundred bucks.
Two hundred dollars?
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
...Become a Peruvian flute band?
(Woohoo!)
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
What do you guys want?
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
Gracias.
How cultural. 
This is awesome!
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
God damn it!
Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias! 
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
We just wanna go home.
An outdoor mall in Colorado.
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning.
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
Kyle, calm down.
You know I can't go there, Stan!
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
That would be great. Thank you.
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
...Yes, that was the order.
And that makes sense to you?
Oh, that's awesome.
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
Yeah. Stuff just happens.
Stuff just happens.
That's right!
Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
(I think we're fucked!)
Hey, hey, look at this. 
What is it?
I don't know. It's old.
Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
What?
That is Craig. 
Let's head over this way, guys.
Hear that? It sounds like water.
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
How do you do that?
I said shoot them!
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
That guy's an asshole!
Yeah, what a dick!
Get out o'here!
Dude, have you seen my parents? 
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
-we won't get caught.
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.
What?!
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
Oh my God! 
NOO!
Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
Obama's not talkin' about you!
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
Oh no.  McCain? We've got a problem. 
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
All right, damn you! The children can come in!
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
Me too.
We NEED a ride to the hospital!
I'm on it.
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
There, just take a seat over there.
E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. 
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. 
What the hell?  Ike?
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
What's High School Musical 3?
As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
I swear
Ehhhhhhh. 
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
Aw man.
You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
What? Are you crazy?
No way dude.
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
Go ahead. Make my day.  You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face!  Ow!  Oh my God, what was that?  Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad!  Ow. What the "H" is going on?! 
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
True, girl, you know it's true,  that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
Uhh, sure. 
Do what you want, don't have restraint.
Huh? 
Where did everybody go?
M'kay, now right-click on menu item "Equate O" and type in "input y".
Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
Yeah, it's just so astounding.
Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
Um, does Kenny like her?
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
What?!
Oh, boy.
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
(But what?)
W-well, we've heard that she's...
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
A B.J.?
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
What kind of protection?
(Cool!) 
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
So how did it go last night? 
What's that?
(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
...Well, what does that mean?
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha.  Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. 
Yup, he's in here. 
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
Huh?
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
Cartman?
Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa? 
Dow... 
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
Well, now we know.
I know, right?  "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
...Dude, what?!
He's not a fag!
Why do you care?
Hello Kyle.
Whoa, what the?
Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
Who? Me? Why?
Mornin' Al.
Well this sucks!
Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
You want something new every week, fatass.
Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
My fault?
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 
What's that? 
'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.
What? 
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.
What's going on?
Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!
What did he do?
Take that punishment, heathen! 
Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.
Come on, this is ridiculous!
What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
Aargh! 
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
Kyle!  Kyle, you have to stop this! 
It's okay, Ma.
Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
Heunh. 
Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice.  Barack Obama. 
Aww, come on!
Eww! 
Come on guys, we gotta go! 
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Robbed us of our innocence.
Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
We know, Cartman!
Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
Actually it was potato chips.
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
Then just give him half.
What?
I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
You do?
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
Then why don't you wanna go?
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
Please. Please let him go.
ARRRRRRGH!
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
You really think he'll die in Somalia?
Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
Take it easy. We'll find him.
I'll call you back. 
Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
What? Are you sure?
He left a note saying he's never coming back.
"Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 
Oh God. What have I done?
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."
I know! I was lying then!
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
Cartman, knock it off!
You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
NOOOOO!
Ike! Ike, what?!
'Sup, Jew?
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
HA! What a dumbass! 
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
What?
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
What?! Are you serious?!
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
Because he was a great person, Kyle.
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that?
What was what?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station.
It's all just in your head, Ike.
AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! 
I just... don't understand it.
It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it.  I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory.
Purgatory? What's that?
Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.
What?
He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
He's in too much denial!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
Nooo. No, that's ignorant.  Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive.
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
(Holy shit, dude!)
Comoe back here! 
Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play!  Hee! Hee hee!  Hee hee hee! 
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this?  Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon! 
What the hell are we going to do??
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
Yes!
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
And now welcome contestant number 27, little Miss Michael Jackson. 
Go on by, Michael. 
All right, that's about enough! 
Aww crap!
All right everyone, the judge will now tally her final scores.
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.
Aw dide, this is hopeless!
Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
So what?!
And now, it is time to announce our Grand Little Miss. Little Miss Michael Jackson. 
Yeah!
Thank you so much for this award. Of all the awards I've ever won, this one means the most. I feel like... I'm finally at rest. I'm finally at rest! I'm free!  Holy shit! What the heck am I wwwearing?
Ike!  Ike, you're back!
Kyle, what the heck is going on?
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
Uugh!
So what?
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
Uh, how come?
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution.  Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
Butters, I really think we should talk.
Sure, Kyle.
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
Butters, what's happened to you?
Dude! That was so badass!
Wrestling is awesome!
Why did they have us put on long underwear.
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.
Cool!
Yeah, what are you? A child molester?
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
Jeez they're so young.
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
Are you serious?
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
Irene, no! Why?
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
Yeah!
Let's do this! One! Two!
We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
What dude? 
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Oh my God... Oh my God...
I'm freaking out...
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
(Yep.)
What are you talking about?
He's right.
What?
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
So what do we do?
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
Thank you. 
That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
It isn't fair. All my hard work.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  That wrestling show is in for a big surprise.  I'm putting an end to this once and for all!  Hyaaaaa!
He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 
Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
Wait a minute. Who is that?
It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. 
You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! 
What?
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
Hello? Stan?
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
This... is exactly what I needed.
That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all. 
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
Oh, what the hell?! 
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Yes.
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
Sounds good.
Really nice work, guys.
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
Yeah, we did that!
Yeah!
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
Gay people?
We aren't talking about gay people.
Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
We're sorry, Mayor.
There's fags everywhere!
We gotta run! 
Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. 
Yeah. You definitely made your point.
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
I don't either.
We did it! Yeah!
Yeah! We did it, you guys! 
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
Will somebody shut him up?
Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
Oh God, no! 
The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
"These, are the morning announcements." 
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
Dude, this is awesome.
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
Okay, go ahead. 
Okay, thanks. 
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
Okay.
All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
No they don't!
To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.
Dude!
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
NO!
You bet!
I'm not getting back in the water.
Aw come on, Kyle.
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
Not everybody pees in pools.
Do you pee in the pool?
Not today... yet.
Aw, come on!
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
Most likely.
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
So what?
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
Well then they're not minorities, are they?
...What do you mean?
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
The black and brown people.
No, you're the minority!
You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?
Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 
Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.
Eewww! 
Look out for the pee! 
Aaaaah! Gross! 
Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Aw, sick! 
My God, he's become full of rage!
Aahhh...
Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
No way!
Come on, Kyle!
Dude, that's all pee!
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
I'll die if I do swim in it!
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
...What?!
Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
Not... all the time.
That is gross!!
Kyle, come on!
Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
It's out of control!  Find an antidote that works! 
Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.
Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? 
No.
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
Not in pee!
Please-a you have to hurry!  I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.
Oh who pees in the shower?
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!
Jesus Christ!
Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.
Let's just get this over with!
You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?
Yes.
Good-a. Now just one last thing.  You need to drink-a some pee.
What?!
You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
Why?!
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.
No!
Come on, dude!
I'm thinking about it!
There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! 
Gah, ah.  Gaagh.
You can do it, Kyle!
Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 
All right, they finally came for us. 
Are you fucking kidding me?! 
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
You all need to eat your banana immediately!
What the hell for?!
Eat the banana or we have to put you down!
AAAAAAAA!
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
(Woo hoo!)
Jesus, dude.
Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow?  Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered "What handkerchief?"  A-ha! You three boys, please come with me. 
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.
What?!
We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.
Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
So what happens to us now?
Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.
Oh God, it's true.
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
Butters! Butters, stop it!
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
No! Butters, stop! 
Haah! Leave me alone! 
Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive  "Internet porn." Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row.
Hello?
And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
Good, yes!
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.
...As soon as what's dead? 
Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
Quick, give that boy a gun! 
What?
Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs. 
What bastard?
We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?
I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 
No on, come on, let's read it now!
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"
Why the hell was this book banned?!
Aww. Dangit. 
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
Yeah, sweet.
(Awesome.)
The Tale of... 
(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)
Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
Huh?
What? 
Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
Yeah, we wrote that!
Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
God-damnit!
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
You just fail to understand what the author meant.
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?
Yes!
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
What?! 
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
(Huh?)
Butters wrote a second book!
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
We can get people to believe us now!
Some of the imagery is unbelievable
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
So where's the KFC now?
I gotta get to the doctor! 
...so no KFC?
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
How many friends do you have, Kenny?
(Sixty two)
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. 
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
His friend lives on a farm?
I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
Can I come in?
Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?
I... don't... have... any... friends...
What?
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
NO.
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
Okay it says I'm at your farm.
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
No. What's chatroulette?
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
That's just a guy's penis too!
Okay let's, let's try this one.
Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm.
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
After him!
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
You're an asshole, Kyle!
...What?
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
Dude, w-what are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Profile status?
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
Dude! Fuck your crops! 
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
Where?
Café World.
Son of a bitch! 
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
Gary Johnson thinks the pictures are fantastic!
Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.
What? Why?
User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
Ignore.
Unh, that does it!
Oh...
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!
You should know, fatass.
And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
I'm not a fudge packer!
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!
Dude, what did you do?
Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 
Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! 
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?
There doesn't have to be...
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
They want his power?
What kind of extremists are these? 
I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers.
We can't give him over to the gingers!
Sorry, boys. I tried.
Aw crap.
Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
(What?)
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
...Yeah.
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
Very well.
Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! 
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
It's all that matters!
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
Oh, you are not doing that again!
Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!
Stop talking with your stupid hand!
Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
Dude!
No no, you don't understand.
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
What did you say?!
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
My dad was a ginger!
Wwait, what?
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
You gotta be kidding me!
I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!
When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here!
Please, sir.
Kyle?
Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
You have to let him finish, Towelie.
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
We're here for Towelie, fatass!
I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
This is serious, you fucking asshole!
Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions.
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
Oh my God!
Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
What?!
You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"? 
Muff cabbage!
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
She said they're from New Jersey.
New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?
Know what, Ma?
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
Yeah, let's get this party started. 
Where the hell are they coming from?! 
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
Hey, dudes.
Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
What are you talking about?
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
So what?
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
No, it doesn't!
He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
What's strike three?!
You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
Shut the fuck up!  What?
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
Why does it matter?!
Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
No, it isn't!
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.
Kyle? You in there?
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
Kyle, open the door.
Not now, Mom. Please.
Kyle, this instant! One, two. 
All right, all right. 
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
What am I, Mom?
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
What are you saying?!
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
No! I don't wanna look like this!
Aaaahhhhh! 
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
That's enough!
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
Why?
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
Why? 
Agggh! Agggh!  No! 
Dude.
Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth...
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
What's it say?
No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
Dude. What's wrong with you?
I don't... I don't know.
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
Can I have a Pop Tart?
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
Come on. You can do it.  That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster.  You are amazing. Switch arms.  Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster.  I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes.  Your workout is finished. Your cab fare.  Now going to sleep mode. 
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
That's stupid, Cartman.
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
(Yeah, it's really good.)
Let's hear it, Cartman!
And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen , and Giata De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
So, plug it in.
YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. 
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
There he is!  Hello Kyle, we're from Apple. We're all ready for you now. 
What? Ready for what?
83 pounds, sir.
What "agreement"?!
83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.
Hey! You can't do that! 
You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
What are you talking about?!
When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked "Agree." Alright, let's get him to the water tank.
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
You've agreed to all of this!  Hey!
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
What?
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
I don't know, I didn't read them!
You didn't read them?
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
Me too.
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
There he is. Hey you!
Gahhh! 
Kyle? What are you doing here?
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
Here he is!
AAHH!
Hey now, let him go! 
Dad! You tasered my dad!
What are you going to do to us??
What is this? What's going on?
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
...What?
Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.
We didn't read them!
Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers!  These three people have agreed to be brought here, handcuffed to these beds, and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device.
The first what?
Really nice, guys.  I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit,  and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now.
(I need some help! I can't take it!)
What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?
(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
(In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick...
(You're fine!)
Oooho, oooh! 
(Yaaaaah!) 
Aarrrgh. Dame kore!  (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?
(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
(In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
(In Japanese Accent) Very well I will iito the cuttlefish. 
(NOOOO!) 
If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission.  Sign this release so we can operate.
(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) 
(In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!
(Oh, shit!)
Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?! 
(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
Glaubst du, dass die Deutschen kein' Humor hat?! Huh?! 
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.
Butters! Butters, is everything okay?
Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!
Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!
Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.
Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
A what?
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze...  Analyze... 
It's working! 
Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.
No problem, Funnybot.
Hello there, my noble, strong, fellow Canadians. If you are watching this film strip, then no doubt Canada is in grave danger. As you know, the very heart of Canada is the Royal Family. If you have been ordered to open your Box of Faith, then one or more of the Royal Family must be in peril. Or else you just opened your Box of Faith and are watching this without being told to, in which case you are a dick. If you have indeed been instructed to open the box, then this is a call to arms! All Canadians in fighting condition are asked to meet by the tree in Edmonton. In your Box of Faith you will find all the items you need: a location beacon, a first-aid kit, and a sandwich. You may eat the sandwich now. Good luck, Canadian citizen, and God help. All of Canada is relying on you. 
Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?
Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!
...I don't know.
How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. 
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?
I'm just doing the line.
The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
And dental floss also is here to help you.
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, aaand Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition.
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
Hmmm, yeah.
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
No they didn't.
Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
That doesn't make any sense.
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
How big do they say mine is? 
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
Didn't you forget something?
What, Kyle?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
Thirteen point seven inches?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
I know! This is awesome!
I'm so happy! 
So much sufferin'... 
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
What?
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 
Aw dude, that's so sad. 
Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
Awww dude, awwww.
Aaaggh, God.
Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. 
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 
It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
What exactly can I do to help?
Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.
Oh it's, it's so sad.
Oh. Hey Kyle.
What are you doing here?
I'm volunteering.
...What are you doing here?!
Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
Why do you have a video camera?
Bye, Eric. 
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.
Thanks. 
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
So what are you doing?!
What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
Alright, what is it?!
Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
Why do you need me?
Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
I knew you were doing something terrible!
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
Lots of people will when I tell them!
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
You what?
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
A thousand dollars.
After you. 
There's a big wait to sit down.
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
Jesus Christ.
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
Wow...
Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
Go long, Token! Go go! 
Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
Wow, really? 
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
Doing what?
Crack baby... basketball.
...Dude.
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being." I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
...You sound like Cartmam.
Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
I need to talk to you. 
Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
They can't make money. It's against the rules.
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
Gut they're the ones risking injury.
What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
The government could come after us, Cartman.
We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
A hot tub?!
It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
Gravy?
Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
No way.
A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this "poutaine".
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
What other companies?
You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
...What?
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
...What?
Shpielerin manshunshka
And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
Vunter Slash?
What?
Well what the heck do we do now?
Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih.
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules. 
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': "Get the fuck out of my buildin'!"
It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
It's what?
This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.
But who paid for all this? 
Kyle, Kyle! Look. 
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
Yaaaay!
Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
Oh God...
Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
Here, this one's from me, Stan.
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Yeah dude!
Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
Yeah they're the best!
Ugh, that's so unfair!
But that's our music! We like it!
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
Gross!
'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell? 
Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
Hey Stan. 
Hey dudes.
Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
Sure.  What's up?
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
Why? What's it sound like?
It... kind of sounds like shit.
What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
No.
That doesn't sound like shit to you?
NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
(Get him!)
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
Hey guys.
Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?
He said I have cynicism?
What's that?
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
Yeah, we got him!
(Hit the X button, Kyle!)
We're gonna level up to detective!
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
Aw, dude, this looks like shit.
You don't wanna eat it?
Look like ice cream to me.
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
I know! That's so hilarious!
Dude, you totally lied to me!
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
Where were you guys going?!
Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
You guys... don't wanna be around me?
Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
Awww God! 
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
How can you say that looks good?!
Shhh, you're doing it again!
But it's just crap.
No, they're penguins! Stop it!
Oh come on, people!
That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
Kyle?
Dude, you've... you've changed.
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
Stanley, eat your waffles. 
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Yep!
That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
Wait what?
That's what they're talking about on the news!
Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
Yes!
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
Yeaahh...
I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
What's the matter dude?
I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
Really?
Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
Wow. What is that?
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
About three minutes, fatass!
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. 
Stan? 
Kyle! 
Hey, Stan!
Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
Stan, are you alright?
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. 
But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
Dude. Have you been drinking?
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
Everything alright here, Kyle?
Yeah, it's fine.
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.
There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Next please.  Oh, hey.
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
What are you doing?
How do you guys make them so yummy?
I don't know.
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.
Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
Dolphin Tale, Big Harry and Mike in the Morning.  Let's hear one from the band Slamjammer and their song- 
Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
Better than being a fatass Texan!
Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
Where is Butters?
He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
Butters?
Butters!
Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
Game on!
Wugh, game on. 
Yes, it's a very odd phenomenon, Chris. Ih it just- 
Cartman, what the hell is this?! 
You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!"  Yeah!
Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
The blond kid?
He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
How do you know?!
Eavesdropper?
What's that?
Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
Dude, that's so wrong!
No way.
What's up?
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
Dude, that's fucked up.
Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
That's not funny.
Hey, here's a post about Token: "Token Black's Private Gym Photos" 
I'm not looking at that!
Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.
Where is it coming from?
Huh?
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
Oh I'm ready!
One.  Two. Three! 
It's a rat! 
Get it! 
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
Catatafish of the Salmon School.
What?
Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
What is that thing?
No! No, see, that's wrong! It's being exaggerated again!
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
Here's a shoebox! 
There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!
Grab him! 
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
What the hell happened?!
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
God this sucks!
Four weeks we gotta do this?
I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
Shut the hell up, Cartman!
Got something to say Kyle?! 
How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!
Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
Dude, what the hell?
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
How is that gonna help?!
Uh-huh??
What? This isn't history.
Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  What exactly did the Pilgrims experience?  How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? 
What??
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
Dude!
Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
We are The History Channel.  For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.
We saw it on your channel.
And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?
Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't "prove" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO! 
Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say "yes."
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 
What are you doing?!
...Uh oh.
The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
Haven't my people been through enough?!  Goddamn you!
Ack dude! 
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
(Yeah, that's true.)
Would you guys stop!
He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped.  I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on.
No, ah I don't.
It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world.
I actually only just said that sarcastically.
HA1 Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child!  Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five.  Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about.  The five are connected by a series of wormholes.  My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over.
But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?!  What do we do, Professor Broflovski?
I'm not a professor.
The History Channel said you were!
You are the fucking History Channel!
You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here.  You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child.
Wow, awesome. Um...
I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel.  Oh thanks.
Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too.
Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
Thanks, that was a lot of fun.
Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd
What?
You know, could youuu...
What?
Would you please just open your wormhole?!
Oh.  Mmmm...  no.
Errh!
Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!
Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 
It's cool dude, we understand.
I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
Uhhh??
Oh, come on!!
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
My name. Is not. "Kyel."
(Thanks, Stan.)
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
There he is, there's my buddy.
How was jail, fatass?!
Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
Is your mom always like that dude?
Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like "Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
Cartman, it was actually really lame.
Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
I know, fatass. I was there.
His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
Nuh-uh.
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
From what?
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
You can always sue somebody.
All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
You got it.  Here we go, the inventor of the toilet.  Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692.
Aw, he's dead?
Wow, really?!
You hear that Clyde?
How much do you have?
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.
What?
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
That... was six grand?
I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
Fifteen bucks?!
Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
A six-layer burrito?
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
Hold on, Vivivan, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-
Dude, that's terrible!
For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
That's the chemical equation for gold?
That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
Yeah!
We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"
What does that mean?
Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is "Whever smelt it dealt it" 
Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
What's he doing?
Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
Hey, somebody is under the stage.
Go Cartman! 
(Totally!)
So, what do you want to do now?
Well, count me out.
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
What? Let me see that. 
How can that be? Already?
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
How is this Kyle? This good? 
Yep, that's great. 
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
(Oh, fuck it, dude.) 
W-what's the matter, Kenny?
(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? 
We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
Benedict Arnold. 
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
Kenny?
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
You guys are sellouts.
Come on, Kyle.
You're freaking sellouts!
Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival.  A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it "reporting". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal.  Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. 
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
Yeah, good idea. 
Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
We have to face it, Cartman.
I know. I know Kyle. 
I really thought it was gonna last.
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
I-It's good that it became something else.
Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
Yeah, that's awesome.
Wow, what's this?
What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.
It's super awesome.
Fox trot standing by at position alpha.
Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
Standing by in three seconds.
Two, one. Go Cartman!
Let's do this. 
Cartman? Go, Cartman.
No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
So interesting, wow. 
Get out of here.
Oh, hey, Kyle.
Get. Outta here! 
Well, you're very welcome.
What are you gonna do?
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
No?
Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
What does that have to do with Passover?
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
What are you doing?
Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
What does that mean?
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
That's just how God is.
Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
This is what God told us to do!
No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
You'll see! 
Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
Yeah.
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
I know, you're not.
Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
Happy Passover, Cartman. 
Heh, h-hey fellas. 
Where's your lunch, Butters?
He has a point.
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
Still balls.
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)
Pansy.
Butters, you're the star of the video!
He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!
Why are you doing this, Stan?
To stop bullying.
You're gonna stop bullying.
YES.
With Cartman singing about his vagina.
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
Oh yeah.
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
...What, what was the question again?
If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. 
AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 
Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out.  The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 
We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
We've definitely not done that before!
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Cool! Ziplining.
All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
Good. How are you?
So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!"
We don't mind.
Let's get out there and get zippin'! 
Jesus Christ!
...Shuttle?
How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing.  Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen.  Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months.  And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew.  The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas.  When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter.  Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. 
Dude, did you fart?!
Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!
Well? How was it, Cartman?
Alright Kyle, give me a "Zipliiine!"
Zipline. 
Shockabra! 
It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
"The next zipline? What are you talking about?"
E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
And it was like WHAM. 
STOP!
Everyone back in the shuttle!
NOOOO! 
Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.
Wugh!
Could you get another picture of us? 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
Help! Somebody! Help us! 
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 
We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
Me?!
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
You fat piece of shit!
But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea.  Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea.  But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew.  His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste.  The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear.  Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb.
DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.
Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
Well I think we can set ya up.
Oh, thank God!
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
AAAAH! 
Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. 
Can we please go faster?!
We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
AAAAAAAAAAH!
Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!
Just go. Go without me.
No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
What's the point?
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat  which is only allowed to go five miles an hour. 
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat" 
Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. 
Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
You... You killed Kenny! 
You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 
You came for us!
Mr. Hankey!
Guess!
Just tell us, Butters.
Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
Will you shut the hell up?! 
Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.
Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
Coach wanted me to...  I'm sorry. 
Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
Yyeah.
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
She likes basketball.
Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
Well- Hey Kyle,  we were headed over to the mall. You wanna go with us?
Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
Really?
It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
You motherfucker! 
Kyle, Jesus Christ!
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
What?!
Nothing.
Who is Cupid Me?!
Nobody.
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
God-damnit! 
I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
Hey man. You okay?
Yeah.
What happened? It just didn't work out?
Yeah I guess.
So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
Yeah.
So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
Yeah, we're through.
Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. 
Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?
Where are you going?
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
We don't have kickoffs anymore. 
Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
We don't even understand how this game is played.
Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs!
Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 
We can't.
'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
We need you, Butters. You're the man! 
Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
I'm not fat, Kyle.
Right, you're not fat.
Whoa duude!
Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
Why do they even allow those things in stored?
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
You've gotta be kidding me!
Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
Why? 
I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
Oh no!
Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
You don't need that! Get off of it.
Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
What??
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
So take a shit somewhere else!
Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
You have got to be kidding me!
What, Kyle?! 
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
Who's Honey Boo Boo?
Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo!  Now get up and wave to them judges!  We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. 
Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
Come on, hurry it up in there! 
Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 
Fatty Doo Doo?
Who's that scootin' on a scooter? Fatty Doo Doo
Who's got doodoo like a fatty scoop de do?
What?
Come in.
What have you done?
I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.
When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?
When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
Dude! Dude, not cool!
What?
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
What? Oh my God.
It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
It actually aired last night.
You found a network to buy it?
Dude, you okay? 
I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place. 
Huh?
What the hell is going on?
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
Do it harder, UPS man!
Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
Yes! Yes!
I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!
Oh no...
Dude, what happened?
Take a look. 
What's this? 
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Dude, no way!
Yeah dude. 
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? 
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
Well are you gonna tell your dad?
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
What?
Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with...  INsecurity.
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
I know...
HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
What?!
Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
That's right, Kyle.
And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?
Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
What?
Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
What's going on?
You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
Hello?!
Dude, come down here!
Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
Butters?  Why?
Get out of here, all of ya! 
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
What?
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
But what about the costume contest?!
What's going on, Kyle?
Stan can't come.
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
Oh never mind, I hate him again.
Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
He looks fine.
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
What? What's he doing?
Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
You guys, we've gotta stop it!
Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
Hey, where did you guys go?
Oh, sorry dude.
It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies. 
For Odin! For Asgard!
Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
Oh my God!
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
Stan! 
Guys, you're okay!
What happened to you?
The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. 
Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 
Stan?
Hey dude.
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! 
Did you do it?
If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh.
What are you people talking about?
Yeah. 
Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
Thanks Kyle.
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
Why does it matter?!
Because you kind of made it matter.
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
S-so you did superglue it.
Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
Absolutely! Five dollars please.
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever. 
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
Hey Kyle. What's up?
Nothing, watching the election results.
Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
What?!
Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
Sure you do!
What if I did, Kyle?
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
Pretty sweet, huh?
What the hell is this?
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
I don't believe it.
No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
Why do you have these?
Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
Dude!
Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
Knock it off, Cartman!
Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
Upstairs! First door to the left!
I know my rights! Stop right now! 
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry. 
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
Butters, you know something, don't you?!
Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
What did Cartman tell you?!
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
Tell us what you know right now!
It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Then you have to tell us!
Well... hah... HWAAAH! 
Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! 
Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.
Can we please just try and talk to him?
What's up fellas?
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
Bleh, ogayedmi.
I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
AGH! No! Please! You can't!
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
(At Red Lobster.)
Where?
(Red Lobster!)
What?
Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!
All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure!  Until I have those ballots  it is not secure!
Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
There's nothing here, Kyle. 
Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
Well keep looking.
Oh my goodness, what's going on?
Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!
We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us.
Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. 
Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. 
What?
Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?
I... what? 
Well, we tried, dude.
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
It matters, Stan. It it matters.
Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?
Oh my God.
Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever.  Go on, get out of here! Shoo! 
Look! There they are!
Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!
We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
Get out of our way!
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!
Protect it?
Well kid?
Well... if you put it that way...
Lin
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
AAAARGH!
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Kyle, this is a private conversation.
Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
How do we have a choice?!
Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
Hello. I'm Alec Baldwin, and I love social media.  But sometimes, I accidentally tweet things that are homophobic. I don't think that way, I just type that way. That's when I realized it wasn't me that was homophobic, it was my thumbs, and they needed to be gotten rid of.  So then the problem was, I don't have thumbs. But I know that everyone in America still wants to hear everything I have to say. Well, that's okay, because now there's a device that can actually take the thoughts in your head and send them directly to the Internet. It's called... Shitter. Wires are grafted harmlessly into your skull and any thought you have is uploaded to the Internet, and on to all your Shitter followers.  Don't let your social media slow down our need to communicate with the world. Go direct from thought to Internet ...with Shitter. 
What the hell are you doing?!
Wow.
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
You're making a mistake!  Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! 
Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
There he is. Hey Kyle!  The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
What? How do you know?
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
Whattaya mean?
Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. 
Will do, officer. Will... do... 
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
Hello?
Corey Lanskin?
Eh yes?
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. "Get back in the meat locker!" "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?
Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
So you know it.
Yeah, I've seen that stuff.  "'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?", "True Crime with Aphrodite Jones". Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?
We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
Hey guys, can I help you?
Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way.  You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can-  Oh wait, we're it, aren't we?  Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages.
Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
I guess if you don't wanna be forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether.
Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
Is he doing it again?
He's doing it a-gain.
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
Yeah, that sucked.
Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
Yeah. So bad.
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
You're a murderer.
Heheh, yeah. 
Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. 
Hey Ike, how's it going?
Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm on my computer! 
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
Do I look like I wanna do fuckin' fingerpaints?!  Look at the fuckin' zits on my face!
Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!
Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
Dancy Dance is my favorite.
It always has been. See? This is nice. 
Who would you rather fuck?  Foofa or Toodee?
What?
I wanna fuck Foofa.  I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man.  I bet she's got some sweet strange.  I don't even know what the fuck Muno is.
Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
No, I just don't think it's healthy.
Come in, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?
No.
Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment.  Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment.  Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
Right now.
Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
I don't know.
Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu.  Oh... Damnit. Okay now, back.  Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off.  Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?
What?
Okay, let's see, lights.  Mood.  Start counseling timer.  Okay there we go. Okay, we got it.  Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
Yeah, he just seems so young.
This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!
Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home.
What the fuck is going on?!
You're fucking stupid, Kyle! 
I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
He doesn't even let me near him!
That sucks, dude.
What??
I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
Oh, thanks! 
Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
Let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone. 
Hey Ike.
Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!
Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
You promised!
I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
Well what am I supposed to do?! See it myself?! I'm a little baby! Who's gonna hold my fuckin' hand?! You don't give a shit about how I feel!
Ike, I do! I just-
Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! 
Ike no! Stop!
Uh uh.
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
A little young for that, isn't he?
That's what I thought.
Told you it'd go over well.
Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother.
I'm your big brother, Ike! 
Can I talk to you?
I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-
Heey.
Hey!
I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.
Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face? 
What?
I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this  Ike Broflovski?
No, this is his brother.
Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service.
Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!
Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores.
Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink. 
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
Sure, no problem.  Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?
I dunno!  Try "strangetamer."
"strangetamer"  Uh, yeP, there it is.  Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May.  Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast.
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
Yes, that's right.
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
And... that's why she queefed in my face.
Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
Thanks. Oh my, here we go! 
Ike!  Wait! '
Get out of here, dude!
Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!
Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
All right, y'all, here comes our next big act!
Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal.
Ike?
Come on, let's climb the mountain.
It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
Oh man, I wouldn't mind hittin' that. I bet she's got that hot Puerto Rican strange. 
Yeah, I bet she does.
Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
About what?!
Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 
Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 
What? What joke? This is real!
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
Huh?
Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
Nothing. 
Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.
Wuwhat's going on?
Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
I don't speak Hebrew.
Anything?
He said they come on urgent business.
Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!
The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
You catch any of that, Kyle? 
It's right over here by uh-
What's goin' on, Kyle??
He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
Yes! And you know you are about to die!
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."
Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
NOOOO!
Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
Yeah. 
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
No shit!
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
Dude, go to Hell!
You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
Wwwait. 
Hi bubbe.
Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
What is it, Kyle?
You're a fat skank, Mom. 
Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
I just... thought it'd be nice.
Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
Yes sir.
Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
You what??
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
Let's see. Oh! Oh! 
Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 
Come on in.
Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
Because they taste so yummy. 
Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
Kyle, are you sure?
Please...
Well alright. 
Yummy yummy.
Hey Kyle.
Hey
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
I just do, Stan.
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
Yes.
They're really that good?
Yes.
Should I try them?
NO.
Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
I don't care.
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
That's fine. 
...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
Kyle Broflovski.
Huh? Who...? Who is that?
Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
I... I know.
Who else would take such torment?
That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world.
Yes.
You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
Yes! Yes I will!
Huh? You comin'? 
Yes, whatever you want. 
Just stop, please.
It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
Hey Kyle.
Hello, Stan.
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
I'm actually the complete opposite.
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
See? You sound like a dick.
I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
Dude! Do not do this!
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
"Oh" what? 
I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
You should apologize to Kenny too.
I'm sorry, Kenny!
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
Hurray!
The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil
Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
No it di'n't.
Yes! It did!
The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
But it's the truth!
Sorry boys, but we've gotta get to our fight. There's a rumble at the Wailing Wall. . They leave, and Kyle turns around
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
The House of Greyhawk?
Larry and Brad Stoltsky
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
Yeah.
Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
That's right.
If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
Right. Let's all get PS4s.
No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 
No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
I like the PS4's controller better.
Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
I know.
The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
I don't know.
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
This isn't helping us, Butters!
Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Ah!
Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!" 
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?
Grounded? For what?
That could be up to you.
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
What?
That doesn't even make sense.
Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
What I started? How dare you!
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
Because, because what? Because he's cute?
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
So what are you saying, Kyle?!
I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
What? 
Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
Nobody saw that coming.
Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
Hey, that could work.
Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
I swear, Stan.
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
Yes, he did.
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
What the hell did you do??
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
No. Tell me you didn't!
He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?
Huh? Hello? Who is that? 
Stan, it's me.
Get out of here!
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
You didn't?
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Stan, don't say that.
Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
What the hell is this?!
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
The fight is over, Cartman!
You will not interfere, Bill Gates! These-a children will get their PS4s! 
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
They're not a part of your betrayal?
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
Stan?
You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
Yes! 
...Meh. 
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
Maybe later, 'kay?
Well what are you watching?
How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go.  Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! 
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
What's a PewDiePie do?
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
I love Candy Crush.
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
(Commentary?)
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. 
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
What the fuck?!
Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
CartmaaanBrah!
What do you think you're doing?!
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
What are you talking about?
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
Let's Plays?
Hey, what's up?
You're not gonna believe this.
Oh no, what now?
I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
Yeah?
Come on! 
He's just laying there.
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
PewDiePie!
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
Grandpa?
This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 
It's dying. The living room is... dying.
Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
Oh God.
Do you mind?!
Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
What the hell is that?
It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
Heheyehah.
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
Barking vaginal belch.
Nah.
Bloody butt cough.
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
That's available! Congratulations!
It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
No, we don't wanna do anything.
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
What?! Tell us!
Washington. Redskins. 
Washington Redskins?
(Me too!)
What?!
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
You alright dude?
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
Another two dollars!
No way!
Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
That's the Catholic Church!
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
That's the NFL!
Oh no!
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
Maybe I'll start my own company.
Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls". It's just a bold new way that we can say "We don't fucking care." Go Redskins! 
It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
Yeah...
You okay, bro?
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Give it time, it'll grow on you.
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
Well whattaya mean?
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. 
Good luck with your company, dude.
Yeah. Good luck with yours. 
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. 
You song of a bitch!
What?!
You broke Kickstarter!
No, I just can't get it to load.
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
He's right. We should do a merger.
A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 
Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Whattaya say, Cartman?
Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
What the heck is that? 
It doesn't belong in today's society!
Change our name?
There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand!
When was that?
Good for you, ISIS!
Well what the hell do we do?
I guess we gotta go back to school. 
Hey guys!
How's it going, everybody?
Sup, Jason? 
Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.
Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.
We were- trying to be funny.
(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
What?
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
All right, that was "Get This Party Started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?
Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
Are you guys making this up?
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
All right, come on! 
Hey Cartman.
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
Dude, calm down.
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! 
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
Jesus Christ, dude.
KYYYLE!
Cartman?
Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 
Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
Are you okay, Cartman?
Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
(Dude!)
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
(Uh huh.)
That's terrible!
Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. 
Are you happy now?!
What? 
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
What does that have to do with me?
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
You were what?!
I was in the bathroom-
You were spying on me?!
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
How is that spying?!
Oh! Hey Kyle!  Kyle, hang on a sec. 
Hey Jimmy. What's up?
Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
Oh. Really?
Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
That's one coin. Can you collect more?  You've collected ten Canadian coins!  Congratulations!  Hey, you're really good at this, guy!
What?
With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada.  Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk!  How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?
This is stupid!
Yaaay!
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
Who makes this crap?
Ohhh hey guys.
You... missed school today?
Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
Jimmy told me about this game.
Kenny, who told you about this game?
(Jimmy.)
Dude, what?!
Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? 
Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
Dude, what are you doing?!
Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
You just push it on other people?!
They pay me to!
Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
You have your crutches!
That makes sense.
You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
Sure. Come on, guys. 
What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say "I have a problem." And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. 
We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
It's done. 
Wuh, what's done?
Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. 
Hey dude.
Hey.
Y-you alright?
Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
Coup de grah, Cartman
AAAAAAHAHAH! 
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
You should probably listen to him, dude.
Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
Maybe we are.
Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 
Hello?
Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
Again?
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Uh huh.
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
(Yeah!)
Fuck you!
(What??)
Get up, Cartman!
(This isn't a prank, Kyle!)
Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
Kyle, maybe this is for real.
Fuck you if you're in on this.
Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.  That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service.  El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.
Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.  Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.
Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
Kyle.
Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
I don't care!
He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
Fuck you!
"Fuck you" what?
He said they're doing a Total Recall.
All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
You haven't done anything yet!
But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 
Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
I know. Let's go to the backyard. 
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Okay Kyle.
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Mmmhmm.
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
Www-what do you mean?
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
Fuck you!
I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
Don't... do that!
Calm down.
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
In virtual reality, yes you did.
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
Or if I did?
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve.
Dude... What?
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
Because... I'm a computer program.
God damn it Cartman!
I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
He's lying.
Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.
Why not?
Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 
Alright, dude, take off the headset. 
You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is "We're too busy."
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on.
Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
This late?
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
Dude, it was complete brutality!
You've never seen anything so ruthless!
Kewwwl!
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp? 
It doesn't even look like they're open. 
It was just decimation.
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
You were?
Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.
Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
Come on to the back, don't mind the smell.  We only deal in the highest quality poultry planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?
We don't... really know the difference.
That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
Then he's perfect for us.
What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
Come on, McNuggets! Fight!
You can do it, McNuggets! 
All right McNuggets!
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
You mean there's more to this?
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
Yeah, you gotta know people.
Mommy!
This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
Alright, your rooster's up next, boys.
Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
Whooaa.
Come on, Kenny! 
Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
He just had to shuffle it.
That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
Holy shit, dude!
Wow, the cops came?
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
Got what?
South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nill, South Park.  Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One south Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead.
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
Grandpa!
I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
Whattaya think?
Hmmm, it's kind of gay.
Really??
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
Well, gay is wholesome.
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
Bill Cosby.
Yes.
Is here. To see me.
Oh! There he is comin' down the stairs.
Hello.
Hello, son. Your savethelivingroom hash tag is getting a lot of attention and we think it's great.
We?
I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend.  It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now.
Wow.  Well that's awesome!
Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
M-Ah, I'd love to.
Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
Uh okay! No problem! 
This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!
Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
Dude, what are you doing?!
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
Who did?
These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
That's a little strange, isn't it?
No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
There's something for every generation to bring families together.
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
Now we're talkin'! 
That son of a bitch!
That self-promoting asshole!
Why would he do this?!
Because my dad's an idiot!
Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
ALLEGEDLY!  THAT WAS A CIVIL SUIT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE!  It's ignorant.
Mom?! Where is Ike?!
Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
Oh my God, that's the ugliest...
Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
Careful Grandpa, you might crap your Depends! 
WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
He's here to kill us! Run!! Heee heee! 
Cartman, open this door right now!
Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
What the hell are you doing?!
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
How do you even know I'm here in my room?
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
What?
What are you talking about, Stan?
Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 
Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
It just all seemed so... stupid.
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
Excellent. I'm just about to deal with our last order of business now.
Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
That's impossible.
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
I am so confused.
This is crazy and everyone is watching everything!
Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
Okay.
Help? How can you help?
Yeah, someone can come change all this. You know who.
Really? That's what you guys would do?
Of course! We just need to get everyone to believe in him. He'll always come and help. #webelieveinyou
Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
We believe in you. Of course!
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
PewDiePie!
PewDiePie?!
Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot!
Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
Yeah.
No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
School day, school day, teacher's golden ru...
Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
Zeeponanner.
Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
Yeah, go home you little dildo.
Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
What's a dildo?
Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
I know what it means!
Well, what?
Dude, that kicks ass!
Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
Don't kick the baby.
Kick the baby. 
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Really? What about?
Dude! Visitors!
Totally!
Visitors are real.
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
Huh?
Yeah, fat boy saw it!
Oh!
What's an anal probe?
That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Oh!
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?
Oh foonuh bebe.
No, Ike, go home.
Eeeeee!
This is it. This one's for the game.
Purplor.
Kick the baby! 
Sit down! We're runnin' late! 
Damn it, he's still there.
Oh, don't worry about him.
No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
Sit down back there! Arrrggghhh!!
Ike! Go home!
Oh.
Oh, my God! 
(Oh nooo!)
Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
Sit down, kid!
But I have to get off!
Do you want an office referral?
No.
Then sit down!
But I...
Arrgghhh!
Arrghh!
Shut up you guys, it's not working.
I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do. 
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492...
Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"
Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
"You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"
Is there a problem, boys?
Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.
Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?
I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle.
Damn it!
Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.  Ow! My ass! 
Dude!
Uh... Ow! My ass!
Dude, he's farting fire!
Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Wendy.
Eww! 
Bye, Wendy.
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
What? How do you know she has a cat? 
Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
How are you doing?
Bad.
Why bad?
Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
Love luh-- Huh?  Do you feel better?
No!
What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
What?
That was cool!
It's no joke, children, this is big!
Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
What the hell was that?
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
Hey!
Uh...
If you visitors can hear me- 
Hey...
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
Kyle, look! It's them.
Give me back my brother! 
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!
Wow, poor Kenny.
Now do you believe us, Cartman?
No!
Cartman, they killed Kenny!
Shut up, you guys.
He's dead, Cartman! 
God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Dildo!
You're all I have left, Stan.
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
Rats.
Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
Eww!
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
Eww!
Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Huh?
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
What?
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?
Why?
Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. Maybe you should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 
Dude, weak mom.
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
Oh, man, this sucks.
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
Hey, he's like Rudolph.
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Sure you do!
He can't hold it in forever.
Fart, damn you!
Hey, it's happening again. 
Whoa, look at that.
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
Yeah.
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
That was beautiful, dude.
Did it work?
No, they're leaving.
Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
Whoa, dude!
You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
Help me doy tair.
Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
Moo?? (Really??)
Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
Moo...moo...moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)
Ike!
Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
Yeh, we're running out of friends.
Oh, hey Cartman.
Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?
Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
Ahh, son of a bitch!
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
Heh, I hate those things.
Nobody hates rainbows.
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Heh, oh, nothing, forget it.
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.
Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
What was your paper about Wendy?
Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
Hello there children.
Hey, Chef.
How are my little crackers today?
Good.
Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
Wow, are you gonna do it?
Hey dudes.
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Bulk up to what, fatass?
I can't kill her Mr. Hat. You're gonna have to do it. 
Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
You guys, we have to stop him!
Stop who?
Stan, I can't do it alone. Please? 
Uh oh, we're losing him. 
(Oh no!) 
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
Gun!
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Okay, Mom.
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
Drive the car damn-it, drive!
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Moh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.
I like chocolate milk.
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
Wow, that'd be cool.
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
What do you mean?
Is this hunting?
I guess so.
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
What?!
It's coming right for us. 
Shoot it Stan.
I'll fill you full of lead!
Hey, what's that?
Heh, that's not scary.
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Deformed how?
A hook.
A knife.
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
Yeah, give me that flashlight. 
(Hey, what's that?)
What is that?
Hey, it might be!
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 
… Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah.
Stan, Stan, wake up!
What, dude?
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
They're out fishing with Kenny.
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
Look!
Mmm, what is it?
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.
Look, up there.
Hey, seriously you guys!
Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that- 
Whoa!
The mountain! It's blown it's top! 
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Quick, duck and cover. 
Aaaaah!
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. 
Aaaaah! 
South Park is saved. 
Hey look, Kenny's okay.
What?! Why?!
Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?
Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 
Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. 
Hiya, Sparky.
Who's that?
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Wow! Cool!
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
You're on, dude. 
He's just confused.
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.
Who's Middle Park?
Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
Did it work?
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
Oolala 
Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
Damn it!
What'd he say?
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.
Uh, Chef?
Spank it, ever so gently.
Chef.
Spank it.
Chef!
I just act that way to get chicks, dumb ass. 
What's the matter dude?
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
Wow, it's been like two days.
Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!
We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
I'm not playing.
You what?!
You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
But I never practiced quarterback.
Oww, we can both be gay!
Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
We'll just see about that.
Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!
What's the matter?
Cartman farted!
Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
No way dude!
Hike the ball.
Ah, dude, weak.
That's right, you get back there.
Hut.
With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.
Hut, hut. 
The running back is down. I think he's...  Yes, he's been decapitated.
Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!
Ooh, my carrot cake! 
Hike!
Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think.
And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid.
Oof. 
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
You mean this one?
Yeah.
He's my new pet elephant.
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
Wow, that's cool!
No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
Hey.  Wait a minute.  What is that thing?
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
Oh—I'm sorry little girl.  But you still can't get on.  You have to take the special ed bus.
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science.  You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.
Mr. Garrison?
Yes Kyle.
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
That's stupid.
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.
I'll bet you can't.
You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. 
Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!
Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.
We can use Cartman's pig.
Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH! 
Ready to go Stan?
Go where?
To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
Who said that? 
This must be it. 
Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
It's just a stupid pig.
Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
Mmmmmm! 
Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.
No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
Mhhh.
How does that make the world better?
And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.
Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?
Oh.  Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice.  Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
Which song is that?
Hmm?  What?  Oh, excuse me.
Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
Oh, pardon me, I tripped.  Could I have some hair please?
Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 
Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
No! We're already halfway done.
Stupid gay pig.
It's more than you've got!
Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way. 
Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 
Hello there children.
Hey Chef.
Why bad?
We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't…A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea.
I told you guys.
Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this.
You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."
Sick dude, she's my sister.
Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!
Come on Kenny.
That was stupid.
Come on elephant, keep drinking.
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
Dammit! This is never gonna work.
Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.
Hey look!  It's working.
Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature. 
Aah!
Yeahh, they're all gay.
Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant.
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
A big mutant version of me?
Is he bigger than a regular clone?
Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.  Aaaaaah!  Ooooh.
How big do you think he is?
I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.
Come on, let's go!
Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.
Wait, Stan, there he goes.
Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?
He recognizes you dude.
Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran.
What should we do with him?
You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Oh yeah, watch me. 
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.  Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
What's it look like?
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
What is this?  It's horrible!
Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
Huh huh, I had another ...
Ow! What the hell was that for?!
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
Really??
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
But won't your grampa be there?
See, I told you dude.
Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
Hey, what are you doing?! 
What are they doing in there?
Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
Yep, all done.
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Yeah, stupid!
What is that?!
Well, it, it looks like...
Hey, he's coming towards us.
Why is Death coming after us?
Mrrr. 
What are we gonna do?
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
Totally dude.
Good point man.
Aaaah!
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Ahhh!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 
Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
You bastards!
What the hell is that thing?
It looks like a UFO.
Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
Me too! 
Ha ha, you look like a pansy.
Shut up Kyle!
What uh, what are you supposed to be?
I'm Raggedy Andy.
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Wow! Cool!
Hey, dudes.
Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
My mom made it, isn't it cool?
No it's not cool!
Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. 
Hehe. Sissy.
Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?
Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics.
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
Whoa, dude!
Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
Roar.
Dammit!
There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
Wookies don't live on Endor!
Wookies don't live on Endor.
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Is there a problem Kenny?  Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!! 
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
Aren't you hungry Kenny? 
Hello children.
Hey Chef.
Owww, you bit my arm! 
Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.
Hey, where's Kyle?
Check this out!
What is that?
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Who?
Dude, I thought she was dead.
Thank you Miss Yothers.  Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.  And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! 
What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Hey dudes.
Plastic pumpkin pails...
Check.
Taser... 
What's that?
Yeah, granola pisses me off. 
Hey Kenny.
Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
You still didn't get a costume Kenny? 
Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
Oh my God, that means...
If everyone is turned into zombies...
Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!
Chef, you've gotta help us!
I don't know about this Chef.
Yeah, I'm scared.
Just look for anything suspicious.
I found it! I found it!
What?
See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? 
Chef!!! 
You call the number Kyle.
But the zombies are coming!
Worcestershire sauce emergency hotline, this call might be monitored to ensure you the highest quality service, how may I help you?
There's a bunch of zombies here!
For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!
Uh, okay. Then what?
All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal.
Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that...
Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
Aaah!
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
It's working! They're turning back to normal.
Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
...No, dude, that's Christmas.
Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
Costumes and candy.
Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
That was awesome!
Yeah!
Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs.
Oh, cool.
Hey, who's that fat chick?
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
Did they say if it's waterproof?
Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.
What did she say?
Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
Ass-raper.
Oh.
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
I get to wear it first, you guys.
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Damn.
Hey, look you guys.
Ah, a squeaker!
The digital sports watch is here.
Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
What's your name dude?
Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
It was my mom's credit card.
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Totally. 
Yeah, that's right.
We do!
All right boys, show us what you've brought. 
This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. 
The sports watch from the commercial?
Yeah, that one.
Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
You can't care for this child!
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
Because he can't!
Because why?
Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
Then you take care of him.
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
Hey, where's Cartman?
I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!
Here you go turkeys! 
Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
Unh  Oh!
Come on, Mary!  Push!
Aaaah!
I can see its head!
UUuuhh-UUuuhh 
It's a boy! 
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that?  You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head.  What kind of sick weirdo are you?
...Sorry
Oh dude!  Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
Shut up, fat boy!
How about the dreidl song, bubbe?
I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
What the hell is Christmas Poo?
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
We can, too!
...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
Officer Barbrady!
What? 
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
Yyess.
Damnit!
Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. 
Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Uh, Kyle?  Come on, seriously?  You are really reaching right now.
Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
See you around, dude. 
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
No! Wrong!
What's going on, you guys?
Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor! 
Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
Ex-cuse me?
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Kyle!  Sshhh!
It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww. 
Wait...
Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'
But dad, he always sh...
Say it!
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Again!
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
What did you say?!
I said Ike's on fire!
Oh my God! 
It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
Kyle.
I'm not hearing that.
Kyle.
Mr. Hankey?
Howwwwdy-hoooo.  Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell.
Go away, Mr. Hankey.
You know something, Kyle?  You smell an awful lot like flowers.
I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
Not real? Well shucks.  If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? 
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day''
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho' 
Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
Kyle, what are you doing in there?
Nothing.
I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...
Mr. Hankey, come here. 
KYLE!
Say something, Mr. Hankey! 
Howdy-ho!
Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle.  You're gonna catch a cold.
Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
Aw, gee, that's too bad.
Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
Say, that sounds like a swell idea.  We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.
Yeah!  We'll show them! 
I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
Hello, everybodyyy.
What's in the box, dude?
It's a surprise.
Let me see! 
O-Okay.  But don't scare him...
(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
Wait! You guys!  He's alive!  
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!
Thanks to Kyle's mother.
Shut up, Cartman!
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
Shut up, Cartman!
Howdy-ho!
Mr. Hankey.
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?  
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair, 
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch 
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BI-I-I-ITCH - aahh.
Mr. Hankey, no!
Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doodoo at Eric?
Uuuuuuhh...
Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?
I don't have a problem.
Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
What's that?
Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.
Mookie-stinks?
Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?
Wull, not on purpose.
So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all.  Do the other kids make fun of ya?
Well, sometimes...
And that must make you mad.
Well sure.
Mad enough to kill, Kyle??? 
No, dude!
Oh that's good.  You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?
But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
No!  Get away from me!
Here.  Just look more closely at it.
Reason?
I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
Any allergies?
No.
Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it 
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...
Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!
Oh no, I'm not sane yet!
I brought some friends with me.
Friends? 
Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!
You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
What is this, Cartman?
Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Whoa, dude! 
Damn, what a freak!
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Yeah, that's weak!
Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
What the...&#160;?
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
How's it going?
Bad.
Why bad?
Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?
The new kid.
Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! 
We told you, dude. 
Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.
... K.
Behold! He is already upon us! 
Ohh, dude!
Cartman's birthday!
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Not yet.
Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
Bubye, Fartboy.
See ya.
What are you doing out so late, kids?
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
Yeah, you have to hit him.
Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.
Hey, you just got here, Chef!
Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
And neither were you, Pip!
Aaaa!  Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! 
Wow!
Whoa, that was cool! 
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
Aaaaa!
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
They were all out of 'em dude!
I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
Aaaaaaaa!
Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.
Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
Uuuuh. Stan?
Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
Stan.
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Stan!
What?
Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
... Really?
Yeah, dude!
You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! 
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
Hmmm.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
You bastard!
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.  So you're going to have a substitute teacher.  And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.  Yes, little boy?
We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
Bluuuch 
Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!
She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful! 
Sure, Wendy, whatever.
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
My laundry detergent?
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
Yup!
Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Stop kissing ass, Cartman!
See? She liked my present the best!
Where's your present, Cartman?
When someone gets as old as you,  do they have to wear Depends undergarments? 
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.
No, she wasn't!
It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
Oh cool.
Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.
Oh, hi, Chef.
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
A whatbian?
A plebeian?
Now move along, children, you're holding up the line! 
Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Hey, yeah!
You're just saying that, Cartman.
Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.
My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
Really?
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!
Dang! That's nice!
Yeah!
What the...?  Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.  Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! 
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Yup.
Down by the fire?
Oh my God, she killed Kenny!
You bastard!
No, it's okay, Stan!  Everything's going to be o-kay!
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
Oh, hi, Kyle!
I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
Ah, laqeh blakatah! 
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
Wait, wait!  It's time to whip out the eclipse shoebox thing!  Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Wendy! You didn't!
Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 
Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
What is it?
I don't know. 
Whoa!
That was cool!
Eeyy! Give me that back!
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
We'll roshambo for it!
No way, fatty, it's mine!
I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
You threw it away, fatso!
Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object.
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
You liar, Cartman!
What are you going to do with it, dude?
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)
What would we use a marble sack for?
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
I didn't steal anything.
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
Good! 
What's that noise? 
Whoa!
Who is the boy I saw on the news report tonight?  Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am?
No.
Ugh. I bet you do.
I'm going-
Aagh! Stop that!
Ugh. Look. Little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here, you know what I'm talking about?
Yyeeaahh.
No! I found it, he stole it!
You threw it away, Cartman!
Well, little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle?
Yeah. How'd you know?
Okay, now this is very important. Where is the triangle of Zinthar now?
Triangle of Zinthar?
Where is the triangle, dammit?! 
AAAAAA!
Cokeshen. 
Cartman?
You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
What the hell are you doing?!
Rear trohtru badt.
Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
Ahtoahtahneurah.
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
Huh?!
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person.  I hear that one of you found my triangle.
Your triangle?
Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! 
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
Eey!  It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
I don't remember.
Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe. 
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
Stand back, Chef!  Marutam Re! 
Whoa, that was cool!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastard!
Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
He did it!
No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!
Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
Disintegration is the best album everrr!
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! 
Go to hell, Cartman!
Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 
Yeah.
Oh. Alright, then. 
Whoa, dude.
Hello, boys.
Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea)
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Really?
Eric kicks ass!
Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, mkay?
Woo-whataya mean?
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
Yeah, dude. It looks riveting. 
Aaawww.
Hunh?
This guy sucks! 
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
Go ahead, dude. 
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
You live on the Eastside, Cartman!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
You bastards!
How 'bout some ice cream?
Yeah, with butterscotch. 
Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, when one of our lucky videos qualifies for the $10,000 Grand Prize to be chosen tomorrow night! The winner is  Little Boy's Tea Party
Woohoo!
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
We're gonna win $10,000! 
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Oh, fine. How are you guys?
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...  Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
You bastards!
Dude. We lost.
Dammit!
Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3000 runner-up prizes-well, see you next time. 
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
Or Mr. Broflovski??
Dad, how could you?!
(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)
You bastards!
Is he awake yet?
He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?
Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
They can't. Mephesto can't die.
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Really?
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
I'm sailing away
No! Don't!
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
Eh-- 
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Whoa, dude!
Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat! 
Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
I'm gotta get outta here!
Stan!
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
Hey, Cartman.
What?
I'm sailing ay...
Okay okay, let's get outta here now! 
I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
Oh boy.  Bleech! 
Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.
D'you have any wire here?
No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.
No, he'll die!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You bastard! 
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
I don't know. Let's find out.
Eric, shut up! 
Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
Wow, these books look cool!
Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading. 
Who are you?
If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 
Hey, what's this? 
It looks like a note.
Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.
Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!
Whoa, dude, what's going on?
Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?
How about a brain transplant? 
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.
Oh no! 
Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! 
What's it say?
Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--"
Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."
Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
Here! Here, I found one!
What's it say? What's it say?
It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?
"Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!
How's it goin', dude?
It is, too!
Just read the sentence.
"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"
Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
Look! 
He's here!
Oh. 
Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!
So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
Cartman!
I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
Ow, that hurts!
Whoa, dude!
Ooohhhh.
I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
Hooray for Barbrady! 
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
It's poetic justice.
Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.
We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.  Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,  so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,  and when it gets back up to me,  we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you…
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
No, it's his bris.
What the hell is a "bris"?
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
Uhhh... I'm not sure.
Yeah, my ass is killing me.
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
Hey, Chef.
How's it going?
Bad.
Why bad?
Right. But do you know why they're bad?
Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
And do you have any idea what that means?
No.
Okay. 
Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
Ham?
No, not ham, you fat fuck!
No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.
Your heart?
Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!
Hey, wait! 
Kyle! You have to stop them!
Stop who?
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
What?
They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
Just a little higher. 
Mom! Dad!
What the hell is gahekgafuga?
Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.
Meaning what?
Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 
Oy, what is the matter with them?
I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
What are you goin' to do, dude?
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
Ohh, boy.
Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes.
You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
No!
I need one ticket for my little brother.
That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
Huh?
I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
What?! Why the hell would they do that?
They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
No can do, sonny.
Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
Don't kick the-- 
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
That guy's totally trippin'. 
There, what do you think?
What the hell is that supposed to be?
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while. 
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
How is my little jellybean?
Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
AAAGGGHH!!!
Put him down, you stupid dog!
"Yea, usher us unto the Lord", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
What??
He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
What are you talking about?
Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 
Fireman!
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You bastards! 
Now, where did you leave him, young man?
Aw, how the hell should I know?
If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?
All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
Yeah, right.
But first, apologize to your brother!
He's not my brother!
Apologize to him!
I'm sorry, Ike. 
Oh deh family nrr.
What do you want?!
I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr. 
Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
Cookie Monster,  two, three, four, five. 
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
There you are. Come on Ike, it's time.
You stay away from my little brother!
Bu-bu-but, son, I just--
You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
Kyle, what are you talking about?
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and...  his brother had it.
No!  No, it isn't true!
I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will.  M'kay?
It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
Ouch. Amuhbuhbuhbuh.  Cookie Monster.
Ike, you're okay. 
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
Yeah.
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
M'kay.
M'kay?
Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball! 
We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
Oh, what jolly good fun!
No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall! 
I caught it! I caught it!
Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!
Here, Pip, you throw. 
Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
I'm not French--
Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.
Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. 
No. No, it'll be okay!
Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on. 
Oh-- Noooo!
Are you Kyle Broflovski? 
Ye-yes.
I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
Ye-yes.
Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know.
So open them. 
Oh!  Phew.
Now, what seems to be the problem?
Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack. 
AAGGGGGHHHH!!
What?
OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head.
AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
No. No-it looked dead.
Wa-was it wearing clothes?
Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
Eewwww!
And then she walked over to--
So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
Uhhhh... Yeah. 
Aw, do we have to?
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
Great job, children! Just stay focused now.
Go for it, Pip. 
Oh, bother.
Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap. 
Get him, Frenchy!
Okay, what have you got?
Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
What? We did it! Children, we won!
Wow, that was easy.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows! 
Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.
But we could get killed!
So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? 
Dude, what does that mean?
Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 
Yeah, you're from China.
You don't?
But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You... bastards...
As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation.  Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows! 
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
Agghh!
Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
Yeah, the nerve of some people.
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.
Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
Was it fun?
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
The end.
Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?
You all receive an F... minus.
F-minus? Can he do that?
Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.
How do you know? You weren't even there.
Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
Shh! M'kay?
We've got to get him back, dude.
How?
Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
Well, what do you mean?
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.
Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
Yeah.
Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
Ready, you guys?
Ready. 
It's a Sri Lanka frog!
Der, Cartman!
Der yourself, hippie!
Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!
Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
Look! 
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!
Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
It's a psychosomatic response.  I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now.
Who are you?
Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Oh, really? 
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--
Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
Hmmm, let me see. No!
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
BE QUIET BACK THERRE!
Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
Dude, the road is always snowy.
I know, but, it's really snowy today.
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
Oh, she would, dude. She would. 
I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
Aaaah!
I'm scared!
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?
'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
What? Huh?
We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
Dude!
What?
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Worse than this?
Oh, man, this sucks.
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
Hey, he's like Rudolph.
Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Sure you do!
He can't hold it in forever.
Fart, damn you!
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! 
Whoa, look at that.
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
You can say that again.
Do you see 'er dude?
Nope.
She's never coming back. Don't you get it? She left us here to die like pigs.
Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
Don't do it, kid. 
Nooooo-agh! 
Holy crap, dude! 
(Almost 7:30)
On Wednesday or Thursday?
What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. 
What?
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Hi kids, I'm TV's Brent Musberger.
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
Grrrr. 
Dude! He's making ice cream. 
Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
What was that?
What was what?
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
Hey yeah, I remember that.
Aaaah!
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
You... bastard? 
(Oh, yeah)
Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
You bastard!
I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? 
We've just gotta stick together.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
You bastards!
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
Aaaah!
What are we gonna do?
Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
There.  I think we got it.
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
It does?
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
Don't do it, kid. 
Nooooo-agh! 
Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
Hooray!  Yea!  Aaah!  Yea! Ha ha. 
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 
Now, that's what I call a sti-
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
The bus is going over!
Oh no!
GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 
Hello?
Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
Really?
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
What do you mean?
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
What can I do for you?
We wanna buy M-80s.
Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys! I'm going home. 
What a baby.
All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
What do ya mean?
It was in the paper this morning. 
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
Oo bastards! 
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
I know! Let's go sledding!
Yeah!
Stan?
Let's go, dude. We're ready.
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!
Dusty the dirtball
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
Yup. 
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
What does he mean, "living in denial"?
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
There, how does that look?
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
Fine.
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
What?!
Dude! That thing is huge!
Aarrgghh!! 
Kenny! Watch out! 
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
You bastard!
Man, this sucks.
What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three...
What'd he say?
Wow.
How is that gonna help?
How many days left in summer?
A lot, I think.
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
Oh, now, why the long faces?
We're bored.
Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
Wow! These are huge!
Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly. 
Hey, look! It's snowing! 
Wow, it's a black blizzard!
Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
Wow! Cool!
They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 
Sick, Kenny.
I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater.
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."
Cool!
She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
Dude!
I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
I'm poopies, ma!
Well, hurry up!
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
Ky-yle! Ky-yle!
Could it be?
Hooowwwdy ho! 
Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town  and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities. 
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
Well, I'm sure it was him.
Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon.
So how was that movie last night, dude?
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 
Well?
Ky-yle!
There it is again! 
Ky-yle!
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
Where does that grill go?
To the sewer, dude.
Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
Aw, man, let's get out of here!
We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
(Wait!) 
What the hell? 
Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
In a sewer?
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
Hooowwwdy ho! 
Mr. Hankey!
Howdy-ho, boys.
I told you guys he'd be here!
No. 
What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.
And that's why you got a cold?
There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me. 
Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears.
Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
Is that Leonardo DiCaprio? 
Aaahh!
Ohuh no, wait, that's not him. 
Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
Excuse me, little boy, what's a "Mr. Hankey"?
He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?
Huh??
I'll pay two. 
Dude, no one even listened to me.
They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?
Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.  Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin' 
We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
But I won't last long up above.
Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
You bastard!
Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
It sure is -dry up here. 
Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
You guys, we have to hurry!
Why?
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
Not now!
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
What's this? 
I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling.  Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!
You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.  Clo-ser.
Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
There is a-nother Sky-walk-er. 
Nooohohohohohoho-
Wake up.
What is it, Mr. Hankey?
Come clo-ser.
What is it?
Clo-ser.
Yes?
Closer!  One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture. 
Nooo! 
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. He loved me, I loved you.Therefore vicariously he loved you-
Nooo!
I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU. 
Noo! No!
Okay! 
Uuf.
No problem, dude.
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.
Chef, does poo go to heaven?
Kyle.
Mr. Hankey?
Howdy-ho.
He's back! He's back! 
My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!  And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!  I give you, "Hollywood in South Park!" 
Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
Oh, not this again!
Behold! Mr. Hankey! 
Nyyaarrrr!
No! 
Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals. 
O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 
What the hell is he doing?
I don't know.
Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength. 
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
Oh weak!
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
Yeah, it's pretty weird. 
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
Heheheh, buns.
We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. 
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
I don't know.
Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
No, it's not cool!
I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
Yeah. I feel great!
Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
Did you sleep in the same room?
Yes. Why?
Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
Gods and clods?
Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.
Could we go home now, Ma?
No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".
What's "ookie mouth"?
First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
Sick, dude!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
Try again, bubbe!
Argh!
We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?  Yes, Kyle?
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."
What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
Weak!
"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
What?
I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
Oh my God!
Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?
You!
I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz. 
You!
What, bubbeleh, what is it?
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
Now, Kyle, come here.
You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
Stan! Stan!
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
Yeah.
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
What are you talking about?
They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
They did?
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
Why?
Because they're a bunch of assholes.
Of course!
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."  Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool." 
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
What makes you think I would know anything about that?
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
Do you know anybody with herpes?
Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.
Cool! Thanks, Chef!
Stanley! 
Are you old Frida?
Who wants to know?
Someone who wants a favor.
Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b-- 
Huh?
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
Don't mention it. 
D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
You know, freshen up your breath.
Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.
Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
Ugh... 
Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all.
We're sorry.
Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
Are you doing okay?
I'm better now. 
What's so funny, you two?
We gave you guys herpes.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, "This is not a victimless crime"? Anybody?  Children, were you paying attention?!
Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
Hooray!
To where?
It's boring.
Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!
You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium.
I thought it was "plane-tarium."
As if we care.
Hey, who are you?
And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... ehcome out. 
Whoopie.
Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
Me too. It was sweet.
I did it! I did it!
Did what?
Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor.
My head still feels funny.
Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
AAAAAH!
Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
No.
Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
Yeah. What's a discharge?
Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
Dude, what just happened?
What do you mean?
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
Sshh!
Dude, this isn't right.
Why?
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Oh, yeah.
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
(I don't see anything.)
You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
(Whoa, dude.)
What does that do?
I don't know. 
Kenny! What's it doing? 
This says "maximum."  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
We're bastards!
Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.
But it's true, dude!
That would be super-duper! 
Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me.
He's not highly intelligent.
Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
Cartman! You saved us! 
Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
He got a full dose of the stars.
Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
Yeah! You're dead!
--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?
Well? Now what are we going to do?
Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today? 
I dunno.
She does. She looks very pretty.
Okay.
Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
We do?
Yes, I sure did! 
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!
Whoa, dude!
You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo nigga ass, shithole!
Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
What? Why?
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
Wwwhy??
Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
Fine!
Fine!
Fine!
(Fine!)
Fine!
Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
What did you say?!
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... 
Good guess, dude!
Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
To me??
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
We should use nails, dude.
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
No.
Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
Okay. We're done.
Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
Okay.
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Right. Why?
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
Too eager to what?
Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times.
Okay.
I will. Kyle?
Yeah?
Truth or Dare?
Umm. Dare?
Dude!
What?
Kiss Bebe on the lips!
What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
What's the matter, Kyle?
It's just wrong, that's all.
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 
Kyle, can I talk to you?
Okay.
Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
Huh?
I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
Okay, that's fine.
No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
But I don't care.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastard!
Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes. 
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
Wwow!
Dude, that kicks ass!
Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! 
You suck, Cartman!
I'd like to see you do better!
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
It's gotta go through her mouth
But ih-
Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars.
Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
I only have three dollars left, asshole!
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! 
Mom, give me some money!
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!
I will if you give me money!
Yeehaw!
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Just three tickets, boys.  Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.
You'd better be right, dude.
Keep your hands in at all times.
Okay.
Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!  All right, boys. Ride's over.
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
That was a waste of money, Cartman!
Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
This ride better be good!
I think we're almost to the end.
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
Here we go. 
Finally!
What ride?
Yeah.
This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line.
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
My ass we will!
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. 
You dumbass, Cartman!
What? This is cool.
No, it's not cool!
O-kay, five dollars for three balls.
How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
Aah, three dollars.
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
Ey! Seriously!
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Well, I'm sorry!
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
Sure, as long as they're good.
Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
(Nuh uh)
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! 
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
Sorry, kid. Try again.
That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!
Uhwhat are you doing?
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
What's all the hoo-ha?
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
Why?
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.  Here you go.  There, you see? We have a winner!
It worked!
Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick.
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.
What?!
You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade them in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
Step on up, just five dollars to play!
Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
O-kay, I'll- get on the bull.
All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
Hey, this is sweet.
You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
How long was that?
That wasn't quite ten seconds.
You guys, eh seriously, my back!
Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
Seriously. Help.  Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
What'd you say, Cartman??
I hate you guys!
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got.
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
Well, have fun, boys. 
Okay, Cartman. You ready?
Nnoo.
Open the gate! 
All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
What are you going to do?
Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
Eeyy!
That's better.
Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
Dude, I think we broke him.
Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.
..Oh.
What?
We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep. 
Damn it!
Oh, he's fine, dude.
You think?
How's he doing?
He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
Do you think he can ride the bull?
Yeah, I think so.
Jesus, dude!
Hey, where's Cartman?
(I don't know. I can't find him.)
He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
I reckon.
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
What do you mean?
Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
Hang on, Cartman! 
Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
Go help him, Kenny!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastard! 
Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
How many ball does that get us?
Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
You will?
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Ten dollar? Sucky-sucky?
What are we gonna do with them?
We should- 
..What the-?
Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 
After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 
What's all this?
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
Really? What about?
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
Stinky britches, you got stinky britchesStinky, stinky britches, you got stinky--
What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
Hi, boys. How are you?
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
What did you say?
He singing some new hit song.
Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
Wow, then you should get money for it!
Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.
Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
Huh?
It’s the same goddamn song!
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
What's a Chewbacca defense?
I don't know.
Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
Hey, children.
What's going on?
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
See? I told you guys it would work.
What's that, dude?
This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
Did you ever know any famous people?
Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
We've gotta help him, dude.
Yeah, b-but how?
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
Are you Elton John?
No, I’m one of his butlers.
Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know.
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?
Yeah, dude.
Thanks, dude.
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
He’s not dying, Cartman!
Chef's in trouble?
Yeah. Do you know him?
Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers. 
Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
Huh?
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
Cartman?
Oh.
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
Ow! (whack) Ow!
Dude… Chef is gone.
Four.
But what are we gonna do?
It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
Chef Aid?
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
Hey, that's a great idea!
I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over. 
Wow, cool!
What are you bastards doing?
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?
Well, we helped.
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
You bastard!
Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy.  I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend. Wake up, Wendy Smell the coffee...
Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Hey guys. How's it going? 
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed.  I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
Language!
Where have you been, dude?
Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
Aunt Flo?
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
Here he comes.
Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
Well, at least he's back to normal.
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
That's not cool!
What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! 
God, will you shut up?!
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
Yeah.
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 
You seem tired, Stan.
I haven't been sleeping well.
Why?
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Hoh, that sucks, dude.
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
Cartman?
What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
You can't be standing there, Cartman.
Why the hell not?!
Because you're standing over there! 
All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
Uh, Chef?
Or haaauuunted hash browns.
Chef.
And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!
Chef.
And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
Chef!
What?!
We have problems!
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
Will you stop saying that word?!
Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo.
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
Damn it!
What?
Damn it!  Just like all the other returns! 
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
Why?
Well, that certainly would explain a lot.
Like what?
And sir, can I make a suggestion?  Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.
You kick ass, evil Cartman!
Yeah!
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. 
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!
Please!
Leave him alone, butthole!
Oh, what now?!
It's the evil pets 
What?!
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
Oh no, dude!
That's right, I did!You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella!
Damn it!
Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
That's nice, Cartman.
Around six hours.
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
Over the meadow and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Please stop.
Through white and drifted snow
Please stop!
This is Nebraska?
What's all that stuff?
We don't care, Mom.
Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
Cool!
To Grandmother's house we go
Oh, God! 
Here we are. 
Jesus Christ, finally!
Come here, Eric. Give your great-grandma some huggies. 
Agghh!
I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley.
Dude, your family died?
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
What?!
Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 
What is this??
Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
Sick, dude!
Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary. 
Whoa, dude! 
Sweet.
Aaww!
Ah-men. 
Jesus, dude! 
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
I know what you mean. 
What, dude? 
Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
Oh. Arrggh! 
What was that?
I heard it, too.
Ow!
I wanted to make sure, too.
Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!
Dude, it's coming through the window! 
What?
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
My family sucks ass!
Yeah, they do!
Heyyy!
Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!
Good for you, Charlie!
Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!
Do you see him?
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
I drove all the way from Montana to see Mr. Hankey.
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
So?!
So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
All right, boys, you're up next. Welcome to Mr. Hankey's Happy Lollyland! 
Hoh, boy. Here we go!
Gosh, you boys smell like flowers.
You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
You boys want your picture with Mr. Hankey?
This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
Hoowwdy ho!
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
Look, kid. There's Mr. Hankeys like me in every shopping mall. There is no real Mr. Hankey.
What?! What did you say?!
Huh??
Behold! Here's your false prophet!
Well, how was it?
It was a fake!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
Kickass! 
God, I hate the holiday season! 
Oh ooh.
What's your mom doing here, dude?
Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid!
You bastards! 
You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
That's okay with us.
Yeah.
Oh, not Tweek.
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
What do you mean?!
We're his oral report buddies.
Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later. 
Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
Uunnnnhh!
Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.
Man, this stuff is strong.
What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
Don't worry about it.
Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
Aooooo!
Woohoo! 
Yeess, this stuff rocks!
Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
I just have grounds.
Killer!! 
Ey, let me have some grounds. 
Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
All right.  And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right? 
Sure. 
Arrgghh! They took them again!
Thanks, dude.
Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
"And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
Uurrgh!
And that's our report, I guess.
Waagh!
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
Oh, sorry. Here you go. 
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
Liike, how do you mean?
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing
My butt hurts.
Okay, ucka-fay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads.  Boys, your thoughts.  Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument? 
Uh...
What is the future of America? Is it the money we make?  The quests we conquer?  No, it's children.  So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?
I don't like big corporations.
They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.
Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!
So what are we gonna say?
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
Does anybody know anything about corporations? 
You guys! Sshhhh! 
Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?
They're taking my underpants!
Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
That's my last pair of underpants! 
Sshh, don't scare him.
Bad! 
Cartman!
What?!
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
Sure, that's what gnomes do.
Show us.
Damn, dude, this place is huge! 
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.
Sooo, what's phase 2?
No you don't, fatass!
Do you guys know anything about corporations?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
Yes, for a price.
What?
Underpants gnomes?
Big corporations are good!
Good? 
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
That's not what you said last time.
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole.  Oh, boy, it's pissed off now.
Go, dude, go! 
Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching.
Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
Get away from me, Cartman! 
Come 'ere, crocky.
AAAAAAAAAA! 
Dude!
HELP! 
Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! 
You guuuys!
Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 
I think so. Is Cartman up there?
I'm right here, Kyle.
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
Can you climb back up, dude?
I don't think so.
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
Sick, dude! 
Screw you, hippie!
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Dude, it's a dude! 
Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
Wow. Cool.
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
Where shall we bring it?
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
It's my name, and I found him.
You didn't find him, I found him.
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
Kenny, who found the ice man?
Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. 
But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
What the hell is going on here?
We came for our reward.
Really.
Sweet. How about Steve?
Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:
Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
Gorak's a gay name.
No, it isn't!
Why are you being such a dick?
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
Nuh-uh!
Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.
I'll go.
Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
You bastards!
I think that's enough for today. 
Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Killer.
Fine! 
He doesn't look very happy in there.
No, he sure doesn't.
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
He's my creature!
He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
But it isn't right!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
What?! I'm not talking to you! 
What are you doing here?
I'm here to bust out Steve.
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
His name is Steve!
His name is Gorak!
Steve!
Gorak!
Steve!
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
No he doesn't!!
Does so!
You're a dick!
You're a dick!
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over.
Steve, wait!
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
I've got something to show Steve, dick!
Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
What is that? 
It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
Home.
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
No you don't, butthole! 
Des Moines? What the hell for?
We have to get our friend, Steve-
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
Frosty, Steve, whatever.
Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
Okay, boys. Thanks. 
Okay. First one to die, loses.
'K.
Okay. 
O-okay.
So, here we go. 
'K 
Go. 
Ow!
Ow! 
Watch my coat, dude.
Oh.
I have to go to Platform B.
Oh. Okay, it's over this way 
No problem, Gorak.
Later.
Yup.
Uhuh.
Right on.
Cool.
His... name... is... Gorak!
His name... is Steve!
Come back here, you! 
Steve! Steve, look out!
Oh, poo!
Steve, look out! 
He has to be around here somewhere. 
I can't believe he's gone.
Wait, look! The helicopter! 
Hey!
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
Me, too. He sucks.
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
Shut up, fatass!
Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next!  Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. 
Hey, Craig.
Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
What?!
You can't do that! 
Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.
Thanks!
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
Fuck off, Cartman!
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
No! That's a stereotype.
Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!
God-damn, it's hot out here!
Aaah! Snake!
No, dude. That's a branch.
Oh.  Aaah! Snake!
No. That's the same branch again.
I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.
What's the Yanogapa?
Dude!
My guess would be 'yes.'
Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llegá- llegáran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)
Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.
Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
Oh, really? Could you brush it off? 
Um, no.
Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!!  Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here.  Oh my God!! 
Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-
Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 
Y taco.
I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
This doesn't look very safe.
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
Hey!
Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
Yeah. It happened once before.
Let's go, quickly! 
Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
Aaaaa! Lenny! 
What the hell?
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Yeah! Fragile my ass!
Wow!
Dude! Bulldozers rule!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
You bastards!
You know, "they."
They're... they're bastards.
Well don't just stand there, help him!!
What?
Aaagh!  Come on, Benny! Breathe!  Breathe, you son of a bitch! 
Whoa, dude!
Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?
No, I don't think so.
(How about this?)
No, that's a hair dryer!
May I help you find something?
Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"?
Any what?
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
Why is that funny?
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
(You guys, take it seriously.)
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
Yeah. 
Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately.
Well, I'm Jewish.
You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?
I guess not.
It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.
Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
Huh?
We'll do it! We'll do it!
Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys. 
Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
This is gonna be fun.
I'm gonna be Jesus!
You're too fat to be Jesus!
Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
Stan should be Jesus.
Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
You're such a fat baby!
Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Die! 
Peter!
I don't know you, dude.
It's a great name, isn't it? 
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
This spot looks good. 
Yeah. That looks pretty good.
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
Yeah, me too.
Well, get me down from here!
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Then I can give it to my dad. 
Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.
Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
Wow, he died.
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
...Really?
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay?  Hmm, come on. Be good, now. 
Jesus Christ! 
I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night. 
(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)
(Okay, okay, just go away!) 
God, that was not cool at all, dude!
Uh. We've been taking care of him.
Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
(Dude!)
(Sick!)
I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
Kyle. 
Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
Huh?
Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
She's not worried about you.
Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
Arrn!
Yeah, take that!
Dude, that's my dad!
...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!
Dude, those people are pissed!
I know, huh?
Where's your dad?
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
Dude, that was Star Trek again.
Huh?
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.
Kyle, where's your mother?
She's upstairs.
Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
See? My dad is the coolest after all.
Well, my dad is, too.
Cartman!
I forgot all about him. 
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
Wow!
Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 
Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
Why?
Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp. 
Mr. Derp?
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
Shut up, Cartman!
Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
Children, Veronica is moving in with me.
Moving in?!
Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you.
But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
Let's keep on looking for the light.
This... is insane. 
She's stealing Chef from us.
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
Yeah, so?
Bitch, I hate that bitch!
Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
Good idea.
Ow! Son of a bitch!
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
Dude! Just take them off!
Chef?
He's a big guy, with a beard.
Huh?
We need you, Chef.
You bet! 
Chef, this place isn't you!
Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.
No way, dude!
Okay!
Chef should be here any minute.
Dude! He bailed on us!
I can't believe it!
Oh! Uh, hello there, children.
All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. 
Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
That's it!
Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
This is totally what's happening!
Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"
Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.
Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
Well, come on in. 
There he is! 
Yes, all his life.
We have to talk to him!
and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." 
What's tree-fitty?
We know what you are, lady!
Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?
Well, you are taking Chef from us. 
Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 
This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
Children! That hurts my feelings.
Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
So I chased the monster down the street, you see...
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
What the hell does that mean?
I don't know.
Oh-hoho!
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
In three hours.
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
Bitch. Bitch.
Bitch.
Bitch.
Dirty bitch.
Now, Cartman! 
Now, Cartman!! 
I'll take care of them! 
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
Oh my God! She killed Kenny!
You bastard!
We'd love them!
It's great to have you back Chef!
Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...
Mr. Adler?
Arrh! No, I'm not!
Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
Told ya!
Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Do you wanna bet?
Why?
Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
Okay. 
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
Why?! What did I do?!
So, do you agree to fight him after school?
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
We'll see!
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
Yeah. That's not cool, dude. 
Hey, what's going on?
Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.
What?
I guess they don't wanna fight.
Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
Tweek?
Tweek?
Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
Well, Craig showed up.
I don't have crooked teeth!
And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
I'm not a chicken!
Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
Shut up, fatass!!
When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
What's happening?
Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
How?
How??
You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
Not like that!
Fine! 
Fine!
Damn it!
Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
Programs, get your programs here. Programs.
Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
Hrrr.
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
What?
Craig just called you a boner!
Rrrr! 
We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
Boy, do we ever.
Huh?
Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, "I Hate You Guys":
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
I hate him the most.
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.
This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
Just go behind a tree.
No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
Well what do I sit on?
You just squat, stupid! 
God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
Watch out for ground eels! 
Stop, you guys! I can't think!
What do you have to think about?
You guys, get over here!
No way, dude!
I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes.
What?
Come on! Let's kill it! 
Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
I saw it this way!
Over here!
Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?
It just ran by here a second ago. 
Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.
It's stupid.
I like it.
You don't like anything, Cartman! 
He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. 
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
No, he's annoying.
What are we supposed to do with him?
Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! 
Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!
"Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
What are you doing, fatass?!
What??
They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
God-damn!
Shut up!!
Fine.
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
Dowoop! 
Gross! 
School, school! I like school! 
School, school! I like school!
Dude, this sucks ass!
Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 
Cartman! Wait!
No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. 
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
About what?
Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. 
This is freaking me out, dude.
Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
Dude! He got a lawyer?
Sorry I'm late.
Dad?!
That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
It's... big.
Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
And you don't see a problem with that?
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?
I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.
Hey, what about that stupid panda?
Ugh!  P-please! Don't sue us.
Huh?
Well? What do you think, Kyle?
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
Well, this one is bigger!
Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
Kyle, let me explain something to you.
Hoh God, here we go.
You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
Isn't that fascism?
No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
Do you?
Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the "Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby" Falcon!
What??
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 
Why?
Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
But, I'm just a panda.
No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!!
Okay, sorry, sorry.
What message?
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
Wait! 
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
Hoh, dude, weak.
Super weak.
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
Kyle!
I'm coming, Ma! 
Go get the door, Kyle!
"Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
(What's that?)
It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
(Oh, that's alright.)
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
(Really?) 
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
Kyle, eh, the problem is...
Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
Eng jeck. 
No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
Buwor? 
No, Ike!
Buh buh buh buh. 
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
What? You want me to lie?
Yeah, lie.
Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
Hey, it's a bear! 
Wow, cool.
Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
He was huge.
Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here! 
Who are you?
I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts.
You have to go with him, Ike.
Buh buh buh buh.
Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
Name?
Kyle Broflovski.
What?
Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
(What's that?) 
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife , and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe.  And here's a cloud.  You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight.  Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands. 
That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 
O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um...  Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us?  There we go. Ahem.  Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please. 
This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
Hello.
Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
(What the fuck are we doing?)
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)
It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
(What's happening now?)
Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 
(What the fuck is that?!)
That's Moses, stupid! 
Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased. 
It's a duck. 
(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
Don't worry. I know what to do.
Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?! 
Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
(What?!)
He doesn't get cake?
Move!  Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!
Dude, what the hell is going on?!
Yeah, obeying should work out swell. 
Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
How?
Kenny will find a way.
It's the Squirts.
Go, Ike!
Ramek shtud! 
What is that?
Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you!
Look! 
(It's okay, I'll use my head!) 
Kenny! Noooooo!
Hooray!
Kenny! 
He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
Hey dudes.  What are those?
What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
Huh?
You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.
No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
Yeah, like ancient history.
Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
What's the Primary Main Objective?
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
Well, what's the Evil Power?
Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
What?
Duhhh!
Shit!
Yeah, I guess so.
Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
What's a Chinpokomon?
I'm not sure.
Well, why do you need one?
I don't know.
...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?
Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
Hm... Good point; here's $10. 
Thanks.
There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things.
Neither do I. 
What the hell is goin' on here?
Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
What?
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
Huh? No.
Oooh?
Damnit! 
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
Camp?
You didn't know that?
No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?
Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
Like, eight days ago.
God damnit! 
Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!
...our hearts.  Kenny? 
To destroy the Evil Power!
...Power.
Destroy it!
Destroy it?
Totally gay.
Liberace gay.
You bet, Stanley! 
Owatta Beikoku! 
Kyle, it's over!
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.
What?
Yeah, dude, that's way over. 
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
...Ye-eah.
But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
Oh, dude, this is not cool!
Relax, fatass.
Who?
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
Cartman!
I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
God job, fatass!
Oh, my God, this guy again. 
Why would anybody send this asshole money? 
(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) 
Yeh-hah. 
Oh! Aww!  Oh, weak! 
Starvin' Marvin!
Bongi groinit * *.
He did take a ship.
Chede gwodum * * godom.
I think he wants us to get in.
Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!
Let's go somewhere. 
Wow!
Yes!
Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. 
No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! 
Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 
Where are we?
We're on like, some foreign planet.
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar.
Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
*.  Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
No! 
Call those boys' mothers.  I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
Oh, no, dude!
Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.
I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
Watch out! Here I come!
(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)
Kenny!
Alright, we made it!
Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
Gakchak ghm. 
What was that? 
They're shooting at us.
Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
Midik, gmanjaum * *.
Well, how'd we do it last time??
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
Which button did you press, Cartman??
U-u-huh. I don't remember.
You don't remember?!
You got 'em, Marvin.
Yeah, now finish 'em off! 
Warning. Deflector shields failing.
Where did that come from??
Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens.
Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
They've opened the wormhole!
It's pulling us in! 
Aaaah!
Marvin... 
You see?
Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
Wow! Good job, dude!
Thanks.

No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?
Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys. 
Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
Oh no? Well, you should be!  The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!
The what?
Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
Nuh-uh.
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
That's not scary, fatass!
Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
No!  A dead body.
Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
Are you insane?!
(Yeah!)
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. 
Well, let's dig 'er up! 
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
I don't really care, dude.
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.
Hi, Kyle.
Aaaah!
Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
Heh heh, I'm sweet.
Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
Who was that?
Cartman?!
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
Nno Grandma.
No Grandma??
Nno Grandma.
She's not here!
She has to be here! 
Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
Awww. 
God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.
Somebody took my dead grandma.
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
Pirate ghosts.
Then, you'll help us?
So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
Right. 
O-kay! 
Wow! That was easy.
Say, this looks like a clue.  "Pirate Lore of South Park." Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? 
Whoa. What was that?
Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
Yeah! Where's Grandma? 
You're going down, bitch!
Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
What's a "home-schooled kid"?
Correct!
Wow! 
Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
What??
Krocsyldiphithic.
Definition?
Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.
"Krocsyldiphic."
You can do it, kid! You can do it!
"Krocsyldiphic." C  Damnit!
Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. 
What's your name? 
Guh what's in a name? 
Wooww.
Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! 
Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
Yes she is. 
...Uuh, can I talk to her?
Huhlo? 
U-u-uh, hi. 
Hel-lo.
Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
Yeah. See ya. 
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
What??
Get him! 
Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
Oh, hel-lo.
Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?
Huh?
Woowould you like to come up to my room?
Uuuh, okay.  Gah!
Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! 
Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go.
You will?
I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
No no. I mean, go with me.
You're damn straight, he did.
You got my note?
Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
Uh, can we sit down?
Wha-y noh-ot?  Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. 
Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
I...  have looked at it.
Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
Well, what else would one do?
Love, for one thing.
And woowhat is love?
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
Woowhat means "ki-iss"?
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.
Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss.  So I cold write about it.  How do we do it?
I'm not completely sure.
Should we...  l-look it up?
No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
Wow. Wow, that was fun! 
Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
Oh, brother! 
Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
You suck now, Kyle! 
You suck!
Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?
Rebecca. You...
You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! 
Aaaah!
You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! 
Ooww!
Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
I'm playing the drum.
Well, you have to hit it softer!
You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
Ey, I'll get it!
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
Cartman!!! 
What?
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
You dick!
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
He'll show.
And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.
Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
No they're not, stupid!
Yes we are!
How much do you wanna bet?!
Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. 
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Right.
You're on!
Hoohoo what a dumbass!
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
God damnit, what the hell are they doing?!
What do we do?!
So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
You cheated, Cartman!
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
God damnit, that fat piece of shit!
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
That would suck so much ass.
We have to stop him, dude.
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
We'll give you 10 bucks.
Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!
You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
You bastards!
Hey!
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
Yeah.
God, I hate you guys!
Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
Oh, no.
We'll never stop them now.
Hey! Who's that?!
Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
What?!
Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
Don't touch me. 
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
What??
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
Yeah. Thanks, dick!
Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world.
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.
Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
with dreidel I shall play.
Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
I'll try to make it spin.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
It fell; I'll try again.
Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews..
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
with dreidel I shall play.
that's why they're lame.
Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
with dreidel I shall play.
Hello, boys!
Hi, Mom!
that's why they're lame. 
Oh, hi Dad.
Hello, everybody. Say, can I join in?
Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
Jews...
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews…
with dreidel I shall play.
that's why they're lame.
Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
with dreidel I shall play.
Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show.
Dad? 
Courtney Cox,
Dad.
I- huh? 
We're singing about a dreidel.
We'll talk about this later, Gerald!
Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
with dreidel I shall play.
that's why they're lame.
Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
I made you out of clay.
...play stupid games.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
Jews...
with dreidel I shall play.
Goodbye, everybody,  and Meeeeerry Christmas! 
Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year.
Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
You guys! You guys!  Guess what?
What, fatass?!
Well, because yesterday I got my period. 
You got your what?
Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there. 
Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.
Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
Hello?
Dude, did you get your period yet?
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
Yeah.
You did?
You got your period too, Kenny?
I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself.
Ike, can I talk to you? 
Uh ar, stufid.
Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
Whoa won toooo-reeee.
Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
Cokeh mocker.
Thanks a lot, Ike!
(A little.)
You guys! I got my period, too!
You did?
Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
Awesome! We get powers?
Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
Here.
And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
What's the matter, Kyle?
Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
(And mine too.)
Phew.
Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- 
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
Hormones?
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
(Aaaaaa!) 
Whoa, dude!
Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.
Hey, here comes Stan.
Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
Did you get your period yet, Stan?
My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it.
How do know that?
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
Shut up, fatass!
Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
Nuh-uh!
(Nuh-uh.)
There is no brown noise, fat boy!
Whoa, look at this kid's coat.  Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What? 
Who the hell are these guys?
We're not rednecks!
Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
Stan, what's a queef?
Kenny?
Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
Alright, dickhole! 
Yeah see ya later, queefs! 
Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! 
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
You did? 
What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
I told you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise."
Awwgh!
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
What word could we make up?
How about... finkleroy?
Yeah, mung.
Mung's good.
We're not mung. You're mung.
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
We busted you!
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
Eewww.
You dumbass, Cartman!
Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
And-a one gop seven to-sand ...  O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!
What the hell is that lady talking about?
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Yeah. They think they're so cool.
You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
Calm down, Cartman.
No way.
I don't believe it!
Whoa- Oh, my God!  Aaww, I crapped my pants! 
That's amazing.
Ooooh.
Yeah, dude!
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
Are we all ready to play?  Thanks. Okay.  Let's see the music! 
This is gonna be sweet!
Uh-oh. 
Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? 
Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. 
Huh?
Yeah, we knows all about it!
Oh, no!
Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool.
Huh?
I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!
Oh yeah?!
Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 
Fatass.
Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. 
What the hell are they doing?
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
Huh?
Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
Shut up, fatass!
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
We killed Kenny?
We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 
Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
Yeup.
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
Huh?
How?
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
Sweet! Let's go!
Hey you guys.
Hey, fatass. How's prison?
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
A what?
An ailnay ilefay.
Wwhat's that?
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
Me too.
Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. 
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
So now what do we do?
Son of a bitch!
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like. 
Killer.
No.
Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor.
Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
No, I'd, actually agree with you.
Huh?
Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.
Why not?
Okay, go ahead and start.
I don't start, you start.
If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.
And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 
On the sled, fatass!
Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
Go, fatass!
We've got' em, girls!
Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
Awww. 
We won! We won!
Hooray!
It's good to have you back, Cartman.
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
He's fat and he's stupid?
Two dollars!
No way!
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
...Totally what?
I already lost all my baby teeth.
Me too. 
(Nuh-uh.)
You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
Almost. You ready, Timmy?
Timmiihh!
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
Timmiihh!
Right. You're Timmy.
(Fuck you!)
Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
Well, uh, see ya, fellas. 
Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
Yeah, let's go. 
Go! Timmy go!  Yeah, Timmy! 
No, Timmy, wait!
Ey!
Come on, fatass!
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
Did the tooth fairy come?
Oh my God!
Four dollars?
There is no money.
No more money??
I know!
Cartman, what's going on?!
You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
Dude.
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
It's not true! 
Oh, hello, son. 
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 
Oh my God! You did lie to me.
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
Peter Pan, too??
Kyle...
What about Moses and Abraham?
Well, they were probably real.
Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
Probably not.
Wahahahah!
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
Yeah. 
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
Come on, Kyle! 
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
Two years?
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
Cartman!
Thanks, Chef. 
See ya.
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
Dude, just stop thinking about it.
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
Kyle?
I am nothing, and everything.
Let's get outta here! 
Hunh. That was pretty weird.
Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..
Awwww!
Eric, sshhhh. 
How long does this thing last?
Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 
Whoa. 
Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
Let's go practice. 
Dude, this isn't working.
It's Kenny's singing!
Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
What?! 
Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
What's a "quin-tuplet"?
Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two.
But there's only four of you.
Hello.
So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
What?!
How can you say that?
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Oh, yeah!
Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. 
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
I don't know.
You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
Hup! 
Alright!
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
Yeah, screw them!
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
The Declaration of Independence?
Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
...I am eight.
Dude, it's Timmy.
No way! 
Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
What??
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
That's correct, Chef.
Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!
Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
But there are no side effects, Chef.
No, not at all. 
This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
Let's watch something else.
Yes, let's. 
And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
Bastard.
The what?
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
Oh my God!!
Come, see him with us.
I feel... different.
Yeah. 
Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
Yeah!
No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis.
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
What?
I just gave you AIDS.
AIDS?! 
...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
What?
I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
Oh, man, that's terrible.
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.
Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. 
Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
What are you talking about, fatass?
Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
They are?
Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
We don't wanna go!
You can't go.
We don't WANNA go!
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
This is boring.
Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
Alright.
Dude. Being mature is boring!
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
Sacre bleu. 
Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
How?
Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today.  Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called "freedom." They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.  You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. 
Dude. You have sex with children.
We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away. 
Dude. You have sex with children.
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
Seriously.
Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time. 
Well, Cartman
Well, what?
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
Dude, you really are sick, huh?
I don't know, I...
Oh my God!
How much?
How are you feeling, boubbie?
Better, thanks.
Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. 
Oh. ...Thanks?
Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. 
Huh?  What the?
Thaaat's ri-ight.
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
Told ya.
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
Yeah, we got it.
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
Yeah, me neither.
You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!
Not really.
…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)
Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
Hey, boys, how's the research coming?
Pretty good, I guess.
Oh, uuhh. I don't know. 
Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
Oh.
Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point? 
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
Huh?
I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!
Racist??
Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
Ooooooohhh.
Ooooooohhh?!
W-we really didn't see it that way.
But that's a black man up there!
Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
Well of course it matters when-  …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?
No.
Awww.
Yeah. 
Ooh, huhuh. Oooh 
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
Wait, I don't get it.
No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
...How?
Boy band.
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
So?
So, all boy bands have five members.
What?
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
It was?
Kyle's brother?
I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
No way!
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Me too.
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
I wanna be the tough one.
...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
I wanna be the tough one!
You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
Jews are tough!
Since when?!
Since Abraham, fatass!
But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
Jesus Christ!
Wow. That was your best? 
Wow. I feel so rejected.
I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
Run for it! 
Tiimmmaaayyy! 
Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
...Oh-kay.
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
Where the hell is Stan?!
He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
What's that? 
It's Stan! 
Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
Dude, where the hell have you been?!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastards!
No! He can't be dead!
Dude, he's pretty dead.
But we have to perform!
We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
We made two dollars.
Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
Yeah.
I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"
...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
I don't think they sell those anymore. 
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
Right, I already got that one.
Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
Uhwuwhat?
Have you confessed all your sins yet?
No-o-o-o-o!
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
Oh good. I don't?
No, you're already going to hell.
I am not!
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
I'm gonna go ask my mom! 
Oh, he's growing up so fast! 
Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
Why? What did you do, Kyle?!
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
We don't? But what if we're wrong?
Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
No-o-o.
Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
Yes, but-
Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!
Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
HAAAAH!
Us Jews don't believe in hell.
But what if we're wrong?
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
Hello, boys. 
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
Kenny?!  What's he say?
Ask him what hell is like.
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
Yes!
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
Yes!
That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
Ow! 
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
Uh, I think so.
Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
What?
You're keeping that money yourself?
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
Then why didn't you tell us?!
My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
Serves you right, Cartman!
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
Ungh, gay, dude.
There, that's better.
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
Together we are strong! 
Timmay!
Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade. 
Holy God, dude!
...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 
Yeah! 
What a bitch!
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
Huh?
Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
How?
We travel back in time.
Oh yeah, time travel.
Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
Oh.
So can you do it?
Cool/Wow.
I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
You're damn right they do!
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Yeah!
Come on! 
Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high.
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
No!
No??
Less than 20 minutes?!
Oh no! What have we done?!
Huh? Oh... Can't.
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
No, because he's WRONG!
Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
Dude. Sh-she's right.
Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 
AAAAAAA! 
Hey, Timmy's back!
Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
But isn't he only three years old?
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
I pooped my pants.
But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
Wow, cool!
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
I pooped my pants!
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
You are?
Well...  "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
No, I don't! I don't care!
Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
I'm gonna!
Hold it.
I will!
What the hell just happened?
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
Gaagghhh! 
Whoa, dude..!
Wow, that's amazing.
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada.
That should do it.
Oh no!
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
Well, that does it! 
Hey! What are you doing?
I'm afraid I have no other choice.  For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him.
Oh... Okay.
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
Yeah, that'd be faster.
Uh-oh.
Here we go again.
Huh? 
Dammit, Cartman, open up!
Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
You break it down!
Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You ba--! 
Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
Why is that bad?
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
Step on it, Bill Cosby! 
One-two-three, not it!
Not-- Aw, damnit..! 
What are you doing, Kyle?
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Screw you, fat ass!
Hey, screw you.
Cartman! 
Agh--! 
No!
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
I can't reach the CPU.
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
Got 'em!
Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
Can we take a lunch break now?
Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
What is it, Butters?
Oh, no!
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
Okay!
What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
A smart one, that can do tricks.
Haaaaa!
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
Alright, we'll take him. How much?
Fifty bucks.
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! 
I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.
Aw, blow it out your ass!
Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
Gobbles!  Gobbles?!
Timmy, we already got a turkey.
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
They've got special effects! 
What Butters? 
Good idea.
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
You ready for the big show, Timmy?
Alright everybody, let's take our places!
Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
Hey, look! 
Okay, here we go. 
Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
Butters told us their play was awesome! 
I can't do it, dude.
Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
(Nuh uh!)
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. 
Aw, dude, check this out. 
That's so gross.
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
(I'm not eatin' that!)
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
I've got three.
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
What's the matter?
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
(WHAT?!)
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
That's 19 bucks, Kenny! 
Waugh.
Kick ass, dude!
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
Hey, dudes!
Whoa! 
I feel awesome!
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
Memememeee! 
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
Did you like the old one?
Good point.
I can't say I approve of this, my children.
Huh? Why not?
What's a prostitute?
I don't know.
Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
Why?
This is so juvenile. 
Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
We're in trouble, Rick.
Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
Six hours.
HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!
Great.
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
For what?
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
I know! 
He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame. 
...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-
Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
No way! I'm not doing this!
Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick.  Who was that?
Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
Hepatitis B?
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
Hold on. I'll be right back. 
No, Kyle.
But all the guys are going!
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
But Mom, I-
The answer is no, Kyle!
Ugh! 
(Yeah!)
Ah. Oh, now I already told them.
Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
What's Cuba?
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
The whole thing.
Hoh, geez. 
Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter.  Now the country is again open to American tourism.  Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba. 
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
No you can't!
What??
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Because we're your parents!
Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
Kyle!
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
How?!
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
What's that?
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
Wow! Three months without parents!
But what do the police do to them?
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  "my parents molestered me."
"My parents molestered me."
No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  "My parents molestered me."  And then they'll say something like, "Was it a good touch or a bad touch?" and you say  "Uh, it was a good touch" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
What's "bad touch"?
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
Okay, molestered, bad touch.
They'll never be able to hurt you again. 
Cool, thanks.
Notice anything?  Watch. 
...Nothing.
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
Not one adult left?
You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
Yeah. 
Who?
The fatass. The mayor.
Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
Now, can I please have the cell phone?
Sure, outlander. I'll get it 
The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.
Parents. Mom. Dad.
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
Hey, you guys came back!
Did you make it to your job interview?
Alright!
Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
Hey! Here they come! 
Mom! Dad!
Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK. 
Yeah. We're fine.
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
But you didn't do anything to me.
It won't happen again. 
But, you guys, I--
Huh.
Huh.
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
Sure. 
Snow igloos kick ass. 
He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
Oooh nooo, poopies.
Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
Alright, bubbe.  Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah.
Happy Chanukah, Mom. 
Ayaaa ta.  Weee! Weee... 
Go away!
A-ah huh.
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
Ho-o-oh.
Okay, good. You're all here.
What is this all about, Kyle?
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
Heh-tchoo!
Dude, you sneezed on my back!
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
Hey, look.  Hello?
Hoowwddyy ho! 
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle.
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
Nothin', Simon.
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer!  And if you want, you can help them.
Sure we'll help! 
Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
What, dude?
We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
We don't know anything about animation.
How hard can it be? Look at it. 
Meugh. Send them in.
Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
You do?
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
Alright!
You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase!  Don't you throw that vase! 
Ah, Mr. Hankey?
Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!
We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?
Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
What's the matter, Cornwallis?
Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
What?!
They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! 
God job, Butters.
No, that's okay. 
See ya! 
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's.
What's a hard p?
You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
Oh, yeah.
Hold on.
We wish- 
Hey!  Wait a minute!
What?
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
Well, yes, I think so.
Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
Don't call me fat, buttfucker.
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
Well, it should be in the script. All that "you're fat" and "you're a Jew" and stuff. It's great. 
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
Easy.
Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
Okay.  One.
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
Kickass!
Now, the next mouth.
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
Okay, where are the E-mouths?
E mouths...
Okay. "Woo" mouths again?
1  2.
So how much done is that?
"We wish you a m- Merry"
Aw,  Jesus Christ!
Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy 
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
AAAAAAAA!
Cartman!
Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
Fine! We'll do it with out you!
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
We'll dub his voice over.
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
We love
-And I'll labor. 
Tralala
You sit- 
We sit.
-And I'll stand. 
Even a miracle needs a hand! 
You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?
"Awgh! I'm so fat!"
Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
Cool! Now let's try the script!
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
You wish-
We wish
-And I'll whittle.
Tralalalala
You sit- 
We sit.
-And I'll stand. 
Tralalalala
Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
Thank you, thank you. 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?
Okay, Mr. Hankey!
Hey!  Wait a minute!
What?
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
Yeah, I think so.
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
What?
You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
All that hard work.
Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!
But we spent it!
I... used to believe in miracles. 
All that work!
Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry.
Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
I wanna die. 
What the--
(Nooo!!) 
They did it! They got it working! 
What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again? 
...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
...Christmas is about something much more important!
What?
Presents.
Ah.
Don't you see, Kyle?
Yeah.
Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. 
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
Lin
Hey you guys! Look what I have!
What?
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
...Oh.
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
What, doughboy?
So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
What?
No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
What?!
Guess.
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  "Shit."
They're gonna say "shit" on television?
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
Aw, come, on dude! This is history.
It's stupid!
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
And they're gonna say "shit"!
Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
Where are you going, Kyle?
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
I don't really give a fuck! 
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
Oh, whatever. 
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
There's no sand in my vagina!!!
You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
What?
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
Hey Chef.
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?
Uh, from your ass, children.
No no! The word, "shit".
Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite".
Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.
Word of curse?
A... curse word.
You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
Cartman, this is serious!!!
Oh-Ho, gross!
Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 
Kenny's got it. heh heh.
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!
Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
Cartman, stop being an asshole! 
Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. 
Hm, right, right.
It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
Do you have any proof of this?
...No.
Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. 
Now what?
How can I help you, noble sir?
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
Look, there's the F-word.
And asshole.
I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
Wait! 
What a stupid voice.
It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
Uh huh.
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
Whoa
That's pretty cool, dude!
Who's this asshole?
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
O-hoho! 
Wow, that's cool!
No way!
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,  take a pamphlet. 
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you?  You're not really happy.
I'm not really happy.
Your potential hasn't even been reached.
My potential hasn't even been reached.
No-oo.
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!
We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
No, I'm Stan.
You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
Who are you?
I'm Kyle.
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
Okay, it's all clear. 
What are we doing?
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
I'm not going anywhere!
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
Oh wait, who am I again?
You're Stan.
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 
Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.
Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
That's right.
Cool. 
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
He's going to eat his own head.
How many tickets can we put you down for?
Alright, two tickets
Great!
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.
This is a really good turnout.
Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head. 
Dude, no way! 
Good. Want some peanuts?
Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
But... we want tax-exempt status.
Yeah. Why is that good news?
Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!
Mass suicide?
Stop it!
Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 
It's just me.
Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
What?
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
What have you done, Cartman?!
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
But it's the only way for us to be happy. 
Cartman, no!
Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You bastards! 
Kyle!
Stan!
Kyle, you can't kill yourself!
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth. 
Wagh. 
He's right. He... he's right! 
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 
Haha, hehahaha.
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
...What the hell are you talking about?!
(You got pubes??)
What's "pubes"?
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
Oh.  No you didn't!
You wanna see 'em?
Hell no! 
There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
Uh what are those? 
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
Nuh uh!
Yuh huh!
But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
Yeah.
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
Cartman, can I give you some advice?
What?!
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! 
One please.
Yeah.
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
What's in it for us?
Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! 
Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
How to get Scott Tenorman back!
Oh, Jesus!
I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 
Okay, so what's the plan?
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 
...What?
Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 
You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 
Hello?
Scott Tenorman?
What do you want?!
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
How do you know?
'Cause, we're his friends.
Thennn why are you telling me?
'Cause we hate him.
Oh.
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
Not yet, but they will be.
Yeah, sure. 
Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
Whoa, bummer, dude.
Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 
Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
One night and one night only, see all your favorite Terrance and Phillip bits live! 
Oh my God!
To order tickets, call TicketSlave NOW!! 
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
Dude! Did you get 'em?
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night. 
What??
You... what??
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.
Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
Huh?
See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.
Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!
Hellooo, Den-ver! 
Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
Ho-okay, shoot. 
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
Where do you think you're going?
We have to talk to Terrance.
Don't talk to us, kid.
Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
Kenny's a random slut. 
Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?
Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
Who?
Phillip, your partner.
Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!
But the guy who replaced him sucks!
(Toronto?)
But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.
Uuuh, we didn't get them.
You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements.  Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives. 
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
He'll do it, dude.
Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
What?
They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
Ih-it'll be okay.
Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming!  Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up.
They said they'd come.
Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?
He's here! 
Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it. 
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
Fine! 
See? I told you it would work. 
Look closer. 
Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha.
I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! 
You can't leave! The show starts soon!
(OOOWWW!)
You bastards!
Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?! 
Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
What the hell do you call this?! 
Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
There they are! 
Haaah! 
So long, boys! 
Wait! dude, LOOK! 
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
"It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez." 
"Have mercy!"  Yeah ha ha!
(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
Nuh uh.
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Oh my God.
Kenny wasn't lying.
HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
No... No, this isn't possible.
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
Great. 
What's that?
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
Heh, heh.  Sorry.
So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
Hunh, I guess you're right.
That does it, dude!
Where are we going?
Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
What the hell?
Hohohooho! Oowwww!
Come on, dude!
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
Aw, crap.
Oh God, get me off of here!! 
Dude! 
Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
My life can't get any worse!
You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you. 
Lucky. 
Dude, are you okay?
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
Jesus.
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
Kyle, don't say such things!
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
Agh!  Agghh! 
Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?
Awesome. 
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
Satan talked to God?
God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." 
And that's it? That's the end?
Basically.
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 
Look, Kyle. Look. 
Huh?
You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! 
Huh?
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! 
You are up there! 
"So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"
"No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."
"That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" 
"Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"
"Scream for me, bitch!"
"AAAAAAAH!" 
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
What's this all about, Kenny?
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
No they don't!
Whoa, cool! 
That's awesome!
Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
You "beat off?"
Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.
Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"?
...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
AAAAHHH! 
What the hell is wrong with them? 
Do any of you have your condoms on?
No.
Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
Nuh uh.
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
AAAAHHH! 
Oh my God, dude.
Condoms?
Yeah. Quick!
Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
No, you have to change it.
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
Uh, what are "studzes"
Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
Sure.
Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Yes.
You mean, intercourse with a girl?
Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
Ha! They're your diseases!
Yeah! You get out of town!
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
Man, he's pretty good.
It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
Seventeen? 
Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
HA! I killed you!
Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
What is it, Mom?
Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
Sure.
Cool!
There it is. The Okama GameSphere. 
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
What's that?
Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
(Woohoo!)
Awesome!  Oh, crap.
What?
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
Dude, we got GameSphere.
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
...O-kay.
Thanks, Towelie.
No. 
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
AAAAAA.
Okay, turn it on.
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
Oh, this is so cool.
Nothing. Come on, Randy. 
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
Date-rape psychosis.
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
Awesome!
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
Don't forget to bring a towel.
Uh no.
Alright!  Do you wanna get high?
No we don't wanna get high!
Oh, uh, I'm sick.
Me too.
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.
What? You mean Towelie? 
That was the longest day of school ever!
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
It... it was right here.
Where the hell is it??
Don't hurt it! 
What? 
No! ...No!
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
Hey, towel!
Where the hell is he?
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!
That's a towel call?
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
Don't forget to bring a towel.
There he is!
Where are we goin'?
Just come on! It's getting dark.
Are we gonna get high?
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
Your what?
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
Get the towel home  They will explain everything. Please, hurry! 
Aw, God-damnit!
Yes.  Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. 
Are we getting close?
A little more gas, Kenny. 
How long has it been since you've been back there.
Agh!
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
Well calm down.
That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
That's my last joint, asshole!
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
We... don't... care.
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.
Who's they?
In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
Okay.
Go go go go! 
Dude, I figured it out.
What?
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Seven and a half.
Hold on.  Wait a second  That's it!
That's it?
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
Well let's look in here. 
Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
What terrifying secret?
Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier.  Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.
And we don't care.
Can I kill the towel now, sir?
Go ahead. 
If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. 
Photon rifle, whatever. 
Ohmigod, look! 
Our GameSphere! 
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
Sweet!
(Nooo!) 
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now.
I've almost got it!
I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! 
I got it! 
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Alright!
Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
Awesome!
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
I know.
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
These are gas masks, Butters!
Stop breathin'?
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
Big brown package from Afghanistan??!!
Dude, what's going on?
Alright, men, this area is secure. Let's head out! 
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
Ba-a-a-a-a.
Uh oh, they're closing!
It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
Yeah.
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 
Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
Aw, son of a bitch!
Hey, wait! There are children in here!
Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
Sir yes sir! 
Oh God, it was horrible!
What the hell?
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
Uh, whatever!
You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
Is this the right house?
Yaaay. 
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Your country is the evil empire! Your government wants to rule the world! But your values and your spirituality are in the guh-ter!
Then why did you send us the goat?
I told you! Jawas have no heart.
Jawas?
Ma-a-a-a-a.
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
What?  Howdy. 
Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
...Osama bin Laden! 
Good job, fatass!
Oooo, alamalamalamalaah.
Oh crap, it's him!
Shh. We've come to save you.
But I thought you hate us.
We do. 
Cartman, where are you going??
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
Cartman, he's crazy!
We will have to be quick! The Americans are attacking!
Where do we go? 
Ma-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!
All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
Oh bella, bella falafel. Mi amore. Fatwa, fatwa. Ahh, de vino! Mi fatwa! J'ai une fatwa! 
Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
Hoorayyy!!
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
Yeah.
Maybe. In time. 
I'm confused.
Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
Yeah.
Go America.
Go America.  Go Broncos. 
I didn't smile. 
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
Did you go yet?
No. This is taking forever.
You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!
What, Cartman?
Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! 
It isn't that funny, Cartman.
Take off your hat, please.
But I never take off my hat.
Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural.
This is how I look natural.
Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!
Crap. 
Smile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile.  Next!
Gay-ass. 
Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? 
Hello?
You guys! You guys! You guys! 
Hello?
...You guys!... 
Cartman?
What's he want?
I don't know. Let's go see. 
Goddamnit Cartman, what?! 
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
You're right. You're right.
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! 
...Nuh uh.
Oh God.
Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?
Uh
Oh boy.
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
Let's hurry! 
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
Blew a funny fuse?
How the hell should we know? 
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
W-what?
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.
Alright. 
My God. Oh my God!
Butters! Hey Butters!
Hehyeah?
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
Yes, sir. 
Dude, that poor kid. 
Okay gang, give me a big smile. 
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
A-heh, what?
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
Huh?
When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
What's he look like?
He's your age and about your height.
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
Oh, there he is.  Over here, Kyle! 
Hello, Aunt Sheila.
How was your flight? 
Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't. 
You remember Uncle Gerry.
Hi, Uncle Gerry.
And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
Hey dude.
Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 
Cool. 
Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle. 
Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
Oh is, is this beef?
Yeah, dude, it's great! 
Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
I'll put it in the microwave right away. 
Mom?
Yes, Kyle Two?
How am I related to him again?
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?
He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
So we have the same blood?
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I'm sure your friends will love him.
What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!
Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.
Oh my God.
I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in?
What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
I don't know, dude.
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
I don't think so.
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
Okay. 
What's that thing?
Cartman, I need to talk to you. 
Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.
What?
That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
Forty bucks?
But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
Alright, alright.
And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? 
Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
Alright. 
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.
...Oh, man.
Cartman?!
And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student.  Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle? 
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.
What?
Now let's get on with our lesson on the-
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do.  Now let's get back to the le-
Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
CARTMAN!
Thanks, Tom, I-oh...  Thanks, Tom. So far, Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes , Steve Jobs , Ted Turner , Donald Trump , Bill Gates , and Yasmine Bleeth . Their curiosity is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What is "IT"? What does "IT"do? And when will IT be somewhere where I can buy one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando , HBC News.
You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
It's fine!
Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go. 
Now what?
Now throw it back to me.
But it's down in the snow.
...So dig it out.
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
...Well, then we'll dry them off!
Alright, then. 
Oh my God.
Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
You did, too! You are so full of crap!
No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
You blew the deal, Cartman!
Goddamnit, give me another chance!
Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!
Uh you did what? 
Oh no.
Haha,  serves you right, asshole. 
You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry.
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
What?
Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh 
Boy it sure is dry out here.
Yeap.
I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
Ya see?
I'm ba-ack!
Ugh.
Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies, that's for sure. 
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.
It seems like I might get splinters, though.
Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.
Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
Hang on!
I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
It's a least a couple of hours.
So join the millions of Americans who have felt a little more comfortable with... traveling.  Order yours today and remember our slogan: IT's better than flying.
...Hm, that was pretty gay. 
Kyle Two, where is Kyle?
I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.
Where on earth could he be? 
You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.
What?
Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. 
I'm ba-ack.
AAA!
I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
A, a bus. R-really?
Kyle, what happened to you??
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
What?
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??
Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees.
Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!
Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international.
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
Dah ha! What's this?! A toenail clipper!  Die, terrorist! 
Oh, Jesus!! 
See, we do these checks for a reason!
This is ridiculous! Come on! 
1, 2, 3, 4...
Here, Kyle. You go hide in here. 
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
JUST GET IN THE BOX!
Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
I hope he doesn't suffocate.
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
I already checked the playground, Ma.  I told you, he isn't really- 
I'm back.
GAAAH! 
Kyle!  You're back!
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
So dude, did Cartman's idea work?
No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.
Damn!
I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
...What?
Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?
Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope.
Five million dollars??? 
Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!
Yeah!
Re- really?
I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?
Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
... Uhwhat?
I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
Dude! Weak.
Oh, god dammit!
Haha!
Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
Aharmani Exchange?
DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
What's a VHS? 
What in the hell are they doing?
Is that fun?
Well, let's just play our game, then.
Alright.
(Ow!)
I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Right.
That's right, huh?
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
Yeah, I get it for that.
And Cartman for being fat.
Uh huh.
And Cartman for being stupid.
Yeah.
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
Hey.
And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
You're not?
No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
Well that burned a long time.
Yeah, that was pretty good. 
Oh dude, there goes one.
'K go! 
(That's awesome) 
You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 
Oh, it's all sticky. 
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
A trampoline?
Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.
...What? 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
I'm leaving right now! 
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
Stem cells?
Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
(What the fuck are stem cells?)
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
...I hate you so much. 
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
The principal? Aw, come on!
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
She needs to see you now! 
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
Wait. What's going on here? 
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick. 
Kenny's sick?
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
Wait. Kenny's going to die?
What is this, a PTA meeting? 
Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.
In the ...hospital? Why?
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny. 
Hey dude, how's it going?
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
Heh, sorry. 
Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
I- 
Stan?  Stan, where are you going?
I can't, I just can't.
Dude, he needs us right now.
I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
Just leave me alone!
Stan, you can't leave!
Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
Cartman?
Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? 
Cartman, were you... crying?
' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.
Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. 
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
(Yes.)  (But what about Stan?)
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish.
Neat, huh Kenny?
What did he say?
He said his wish is not to die. 
Wu- what was that?
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
He just said... "Where's Stan?"
You guys! Come quick! 
What, Cartman?
Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.
AAARGH! 
Shitty Beef...
Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
Okay, Not-Kenny.
Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!
Dude! That's today!
Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease!
Excuse me? Could we get through here?
Wow, Jared!
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Would you like to meet them?
Them?
Hello.
Oh, "A I D E S," aides.
Yep. Hooray for aides!
Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.
But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?
It matters, dude. 
Hmmm.
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
Tha- that's diarrhea.
That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.
That's a great idea!
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
But Butters isn't fat.
You mean like Jared?
Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
He used to be fat but not no more 
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
Hello there, children.
Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
So how long until we can joke about it?
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Vogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company. 
Wow! He looks great!
You want the Shitty Beef?
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
...Why?
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
Did you bring the camera?
Yeah, we're all set.
Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
Well, what do you mean?
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
Wow! 
Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
Yeah, you're still fat!
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
Why are you doing this to us?!
Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
Alright, I think it's in. 
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
There it goes.
Alright, it's working!
Oh, whoa. Whoa! 
It's out of control! 
Uh- go where?
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
...Kenny would have done it.
Yep.
Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
Wow, that was pretty good.
Welcome ta Shitty Wok. Take your order prease.
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
Oh no, no way! I not putting no Jared in my Shitty Wok commercial!
Uh, why not?
Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!
Wait!  You're all making a mistake!
Oh God-damnit!
Aw, just forget the whole thing then!
Well, so much for our money.
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
What
Okay, Mike, ski down to me! 
Go on, Ike.
Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting.  Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at  the luncheon.
...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
Oh, God-damnit!
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
Don't care. 
What do you wanna do now?
Dude, I have to!
Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
Dude, he's got Heather!
You don't even know Heather!
Yah. 
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
Now, I'll win for sure!
Awgh, dude, I can't look. 
Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these. 
Good job, dude!
There you are, boys!
Mom, Dad!
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
Yeah, what a stupid sport! 
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Okay, Not-Kenny.
Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance!  All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman who head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna giver her a makeover!
This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
Cool!
Oh, that'd be awesome! 
Do you think they'll believe it?
Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
Awesome!
Uh, it sure is!
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Yeah.
Hang on now.
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
Wow!
That looks awesome!
They weren't lying!
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
Yeah, he sure is.
Here he comes.
This is gonna be awesome!
Oh really?
Wow!
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.
City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
Eewwww!!
Aw, dude. 
Yeppir.
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
What??
Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.
Yeah.
What? What the hell are you guys doing??
Come on, we've gotta go!
What? Why?
'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
What?!
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
Screw you, Cartman!
Go on, dude it's the only way.
No!
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
Have Butters kiss it.
No, it has to be Kyle. 
Awww! 
Oh man, that was soho awesome!
Sick! I felt it on my face!
Hell, I'm not goin' with you!
Hyaaaa! 
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
What? 
See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
Butters has that at his house?
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
All right!
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
You're getting in pretty deep, dude. 
Me?? How did I get into this mess?
So what happens now?
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
We're with you, dude.
Shut up, Cartman.
We're with you, Stan.
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
Yeah!
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
...No I won't.
Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
But they-ah they're angry at me.
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
Oh, God-damnit you guys.
Cartman, stay away from that door!
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
But we will have to sleep, dude.
Good night, fellas!
Good night.
Can't go on. Need... food...
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
He might be right, dude.
Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.
All right!
Look you guys! Beef jerky!
Yeah! And fried chicken! 
Wha? 
Mmmmm.
Dude, what are you guys doing?
We're eating, dude.
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
Dude, that's messed up. 
No, this is exactly what we wanted.
It is?
We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved
Huh, what the hell is that?
Hooray! Hooray!
Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
All right, see what you can do.
Dude, are you okay?
What is that?
Dude, maybe we should end this.
Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
Don't give him anything!
Cartman, no!
Dude! 
Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!
Stan's getting worse, you guys.
My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf.
Stan! It worked!
It... did?
They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
We're going! 
Mexico here we come! 
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!
Oh no! No!!
Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life.
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.
Whoa, dude.
Aw, we're still grounded?
But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
This is gonna be so awesome!
Do we have everything?
All right!
Look, it's almost time.
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
It's the biggest night of the year.
Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But if looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em.
Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
You'd miss the new trailer?
Stan, okay. What's your name? 
Kyle.
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
Seems like no one else here wants to fight.
Dude, thank God for stupid people 
They look fine to me. 
Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
Just just leave it alone.
Dude!
God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
And so here we are in history-rich Ch-ooina.
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
Dadadadat!
No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
Etetheh bunlapala un night.
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer
God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
Here they come!
Heuh, the commercials! 
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
Let's see.  Aw, dammit!
Get it back to normal, Chef!
Oh God-dammit!
The TV left.
Hey hey hey, whoa, you kids can't be in here. 
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
We're not too late! 
That's it? That's all the commercials?
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
Oh, God, it's horrible! 
That'd disgusting, dude!
Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and  fit as a whistle!
It's okay, it's still the show.
But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of 'em all! So, from now on i'm gonna spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer.  Right! Where is that pussy cancer anyway?!
Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
Will your sister let us watch it?
I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!
Look! Crack addicts with a television! 
Where do we go?!
Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
I'm sure! There's no way!
Well why not?!
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
We made it! 
The last commercial break is starting!
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
That looks AWEsome! 
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
Yeah. 
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
Okay, here he comes. 
Who wants to tell him?
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
Lame
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
Phew.
Phew.
Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 
Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. 
But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy
Oh man! This is too much pressure!
Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
Tweek.
Okay, next? 
This looks pretty good.
It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children. 
You're such a fatass, Cartman!
O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!
Token.
All right! 
Timmy.
Timmay! 
Tweek.  Pip
Really? I don't believe it. 
Towelie.
Just one more rose, Kyle.
Jimmy.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Anything that'll impress us, Token.
I like it. 
Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
Woohoo!
Yeah! Isn't this great?!
I think Towelie is awesome.
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
Oh, this is giving me a headache.
Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
Token's a smartass.
So? You're a smartass!
Yeah. Do we really need another one?
Good point. 
That's great.
Cool.
I can't.  You do it.
Just stick it on.
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
Yeah.
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Yeah.
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
No way.
Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
Nuh uh.
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
No way.
Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
Gah! Me too.
Ah, alright.
I got RIPPED OFF! 
I told you, Cartman.
Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
Oh, what is it? 
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
Oh God!
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
Chef, we did something kind of bad.
We don't know who else to talk to.
So what should we do? 
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
Oh, God. 
There's nothing here! 
Is it her?
Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. 
Aaah!
Quick. Hide. 
No, that's not... 
Got it!
Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.
It is?
Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
Oh, really?? 
G'night, guys.
I'm so glad we're not murderers. 
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! 
Whoa. 
I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
Whoa.
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
Well what are you gonna do?
And I've got the sea men. 
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Hm.
Huh.
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
...So?
...Yeah. So?
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
Hey! It's Tweek.
What's going on now?
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Maybe... No.
Hey dudes.
Arr!
What are you guys doin'?
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
In your butts?
Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
Why would he put anything in your butts?
Hm.
Hm. 
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
Yeah.
Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
It wouldn't work!
Have you ever tried it?
I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
You're on, fat boy!
Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.
Well, Cartman?
Oh. 
Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 
Get the fuck out of here!
Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
What?
So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen   Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal.
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
So?
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
You were totally, one hundred percent right.
Heh...  what?
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
You asshole! 
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club
Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 
"Free hat?"
I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
Goohoo!
Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
To do what?
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
What?
Really? That's great.
Yah.
But just remember that I do all the talking.
You?? Why?
Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! 
Me.
Ga-ahah!
Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.
Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ewver did.
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!
No. NOO!!
YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Nonono! We need to do this first.
No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
This looks like the right room.
Over here! 
That's it!
Aaaaaah!
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
...No, he has an icy heart.
...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
It's a cool island song.
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
It is... too late for me, boys.
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?!  Don't forget: you belong to me.
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
Now take the children prisoner! 
What??
He's definitely lost it
Yup.
Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back!  Okay kid, you win.  Blow it up.  Zuroch!  Zuroch!  Blow it back to God.  All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I. 
Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!
Yuh, you guys okay. 
Yeah. I I think so.
Yeah! Woohoohoo!
...What? 
Oh my God!
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
Oh, but I thought your teacher died.
She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems.  M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do uh, four time four, m'kay?
Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
I don't know. 
Yeah!
Dude! Bebe is really smart!
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
Yeah, it's cool.
Hahahahahaha...
Yeah.
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
Yeah. She's really cool. 
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-
I'm showing her.
Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-
Hoh!
Hoh hoh hoh! 
Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 
Hoh hoh hoh!
Hah hah hah!
...Wait, what were we doing again?
We were throwing rocks at cars.
No!
Maybe she's in the lunch line.
Yeah.
Yep.
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
Right.
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
Yeah.
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
Huh??
And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 
No way! Tweek's cool!
Uhyep.
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
Hoh!
Hoh hoh hoh!
You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 
What the hell are you doing?
We're playing "Lambs."
Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
Hear Hear!
Boobs are stupid!
I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
It will.
Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!
So?
So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! 
But, wait. Where's the other team? 
Congratulations on your victory, boys. 
Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
Right. Do what you normally would do.
You're such a fatass, Cartman.
We are your parents. You used to live here, with us.
Yeah, it was like four days ago!
Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
It was such a long time ago!
We've gotta find that ticket!
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
Yeah. Closure.
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
Wewewewewewe...
Alright, we made it!
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
Let him out, Cartman! 
...Kenny?  Kenny?!
Is he in there?
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 
How?
A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11
I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___
Eleven.
Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here! 
Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! 
Cartman? Cartman?!
Wha-uh, what?? What?
Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
Maybe you got brain cancer.
Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?
Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
Do you see anything?
No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
Grandma??
Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
Huh?
You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
HAAHH!!! 
AH! 
Hey Kenny.
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
You're too fat to be Kenny.
When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 
What?? For God's sake, why??
Kyle, it's just what some people do.
Are you gonna burn me?
Kyle, that's not the issue right now.
Jesus Christ!
Shut up!
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
Yeah. Good job, fatass! 
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 
What do you mean, fatass?
I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 
Do you see anything?
Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there?  You little bastards ruined my latest song! 
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?
Dude, come back here! 
Stop him, Kenny! 
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
This... is so cool.
Gentlemen, we are off! 
Wha-wha, what are you doing?! 
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
Bwaagghh! 
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
Well, well, well! If it isn't Robin Hood and his Merry Men!
Oh, crap, the sixth graders!
No way! We're keepin' this and watchin' it ourselves!
You can't keep it.
Oh man, I can't wait to see this!
Dude, that video is making people act strange.
Oh, no. 
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
Oh crap, dude!
Hide! 
Ogh. 
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?
We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
My God, this thing must really be powerful. 
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
Well, where is the videotape rented from?
Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .
Paladin!
So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
Look out! 
We were almost killed.
I have blocked your spell, wizard!
Hey, what are you guys doing? 
Ha!! Fags! 
You guys. Somebody is following us.
It's Butters.
Butters?
They are coming.  You guys go on ahead.
Jimmy, are you sure?
Jimmy didn't stop them!
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
The Butters knowses.
Oh brother!
First, just let Butters sseee the precious.
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
I know where it is! 
Oh no! They're closed!
Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
Finally.  It's over.
Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! 
Butters! No!
They're coming!
It has to go back!
There it is! Give me that tape! 
Let go of the tape, Butters!
I'll never let go! 
Fine! 
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
Middle-earth is again safe.
M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. 
Funny.
AWWWW!!!
Not him!
Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
So full of metaphor.
Hey guys, can we talk to you? 
How was school?
Uhh, not cool.
Uh huh.
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
You other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby," or "lardbutt," or "fat tits,"...
"Fat tits." That's a good one.
How's it goin'?
Bad.
...Intolerant of who?
Gays, I guess.
Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
Are we homophobes now?
We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint!  You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone!  What are you fingerpainting?!
Uh, a bear?
Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
Start over!  You will fingerpaint what we tell you!  GO!  Faster.  Faster!  Faasterr.
Aaaa! 
Faster! Are you done?! What is it?! What have you done?! 
People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
Eh-xcellent! 
Oh.
Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
Can't... glue... any... more. 
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
We're gong to New York?
Welcome aboard Flight 673 to New York. We are happy to show you a feature film during the flight. In a moment we'll be showing a preview.
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
Uh, over here please?
We have a dead friend.
And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?
Yee-yeah.
Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?
I'm Kyle.
Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?
Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?
She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves.
Oh my God!
Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
That's us. Come on.
Four white birds!
Huh?
There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
I'm not going back.
What??
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
Kyle! Kyle!
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
Yes. Right. Yeah. 
You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
Da derpa derpa derpaderp. Da Derp Dee Derp Da Teetley Derpee Derpee Dumb
Throw it away, Clyde!
What's going on?
Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
Nobody wants to touch it.
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
Well, I did Ecstasy once.  Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. 
...Where did you have sex with her?
Hey guys.
Hey.
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
Wow. That's pretty cool.
Then how does he know our names?
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
Hey, what happens to me in the future?
No, wait!  Oh, God-damnit!
Av-a-a-alright, I'm done.
You're done?
Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
Yeah, so how's it look?
It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
What?!
Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 
Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice.
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.
God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.
Jesus Christ!
Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever. 
Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
What are you doing, Cartman?
You guys, that's it!
What's it?
They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
Hoooowwwwdy ho! 
Mr. Hankey! 
Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Wuh, that smells. 
Yeah. 
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
Me neither.
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
Awww! 
Finally!
Sure thing!
Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents.
Wow, cool!
Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
What are you doing?
I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
Santa? Is he alright?
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! 
Jesus, behind you! 
Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.
You bastards. 
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
Kyle!
Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
Oh, God-damnit!
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
Oh, hey Kenny.
Dude, where have you been?
(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...
Ah, damn it!
What?
My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
Suck my balls.
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
Dude, sweet! 
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
Don't kick the goddamn baby!
Kick it!
Uuugh.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Really? What about?
Dude! Visitors!
Totally!
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
No I don't remember that!
You don't?
I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
Hello there, children! 
And then you said
and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.
Weird
A repeat??
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
That's right.
What a dick!
We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
Other than his monstrous size.
Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
Wait, what's this? 
Are you okay?
What?
No way!  You do it, Kenny!
Go on.
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
God-damnit Cartman!
I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 
Stop it Cartman!
(Gaaahaha, he got you again!)
God Dammit!
Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
No!
No, go ahead. I'm dry.
You're lying!
This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
That does it! CHARGE! 
It, it's sending a transmission of some kind.  Got it! 
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.
Candy bars?
Help!
Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 
Can you see anything, children? 
The aliens are chasing us! 
Looks like them boys are gettin' a little fresh air. 
I think we ditched them.
Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up! 
What the? Where are, where are we?
Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
Guys. Look. 
Wow. 
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Yeah.
No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you.
Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
No! 
No! 
That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real.  We started with great shows like, "Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?" and "Antares 6 Millionaire". And then we had a big hit with "Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian". But then of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time. 
Earth?
Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
That should get the relay working again.  All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth.  Oh, excuse me.  This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks.  Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been cancelled.
What?? Who cancelled us?
Wouldn't do any good.
Dude, we have to try!
Gah, why? 
Mighty powerful network executives,
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
Please don't cancel us. Please.
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
Oh my God, this is great!
Oh, man, I am so wasted!  Hey, do you Earthlings wanna try a little glach?  Agh-oh yeah!!  Oh, gluck yeah!! 
Kenny! 
They really got us by the nezmins
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
Uuugh.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
(Hey you guys, look.) 
What the hell is that?
Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. 
What?
Oh God-damnit!!
Cartman, just stay out of it.
Stay clear, guys, stay clear.
Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
Mee tooo.
Boys!  What is that?
A reindeer?
Mrs. Streible thinks she's so cool!
How dare she talk to us like that?!
(Yeah!)
TP her house?
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
Oh.
Should be fine.
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
... Toilet paper  Toilet paper 
You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
Oh.  Uuugh.
It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
So?
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
Kyle, we all agreed to do this!
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Come on, let's go! 
What have we done? 
Let's go, Kyle! 
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
Who cares??
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
Noo! No.  Noo! 
Whyyy? Whyyy?
Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
Damn!
Oh God!
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
Why are they doing us one at a time?
They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
I can get a better deal?
No I do not.
Noo! No.  Noo! 
Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
No need. I have one for you right here. 
Oh. Okay. Thanks.
Is there anything else I can get for you?
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store.  Oh my God! 
What's this all about, Cartman?
I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
A boat ride?
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
Well, okay.
Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
And you feel like you have to confess.
I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
Cartman!
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
They did?
They did?
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
Yep. I'm in jail.
You con-fessed?
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
You guys, we can't let him do this!
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
Why do you say that?
Because it was-
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
I still feel bad, Cartman
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
Yeah. That makes it even worse.
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
I know.
What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
We feel bad for other people.
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
Ooo, Polceman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Polceman Brown? 
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
Hi guys.
Cartman??
My consciences just caught up with me.
That's not fair!
You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. 
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
Wugh! Two weeks of this!
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
Oh Jesus! 
I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!
What should we do?
Right. What about the war?
Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?
Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.
Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
Maaaa. M-maaaa.
Shut up and study!
Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
What are you doing?
Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
Cartman? Cartman?? 
Benjamin Franklin?
No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
Cartman?
Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
Whoa, here it goes! 
Cartman?  Cartman??
Oh baby baby, you can't die.
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
Whoa. Easy, Kyle.
But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
No war! No war! No war!
Oh, Jesus...
Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
God damnit!
Get back to work!
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
What?
We didn't do our homework.
He does? 
He does?
Awww. 
Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
What the hell are they doing now?
I-I don't know.
For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES?? One hundred episodes!   
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. 
Cool.
Jennifer Lopez?
No way.
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
Is nice?
Stop it!
(Woohoo!) 
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
God dammit! 
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
All right all right, here's ten dollars! 
That's not what I meant!
Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see ya.
Can we go now, please?!
Yeah, I wanna leave.
Stop it, Cartman!
Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 
...What?
Wow, really?
No!
Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny! 
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
Good.
Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
That does it. I'm out. 
I told you this would happen. 
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
I hate you. 
Oh, balls!
Come in.  COME IN!! 
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
So stop doing it!
Stop doing what?
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
I can see your lips moving!
See?! I just saw your lips move!
What's she doing?
Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
YES, dude! 
Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
Out! 
We'll sue you!
Oh Jesus.
Who is Mitch Connor?
Oh no, no, nonono.
Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed in his last chips. 
Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.
Awww, shit!
Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!
Really?
Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
Jesus, we're too late.
I think we can piece this case together now.
My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?
Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
Then saw off the arms and legs. 
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! 
We're in business!
Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
Do you kow where your doll is?
You got it, Ken? 
All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
No sign of forced entry.
But the window isn't locked.
Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
I want choppers on the roof ready to go! 
Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
(Yeah!)
Yeah, but how?
That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
How... do you make semen come out?
Really?
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
Kyle! 
What?  What??
I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
They've got the doll! 
You're gay! 
What do we do now?
Why not?
Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
We've got to do something.
Yes it does so! 
...Grrrr!!! 
We go get the doll ourselves.
But they said we can't charge the front door.
No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.
We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!
W-hell, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Junior Detectives. 
Wow! 
Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!
Ah... a a a meth lab?
I don't want any problems. Just take them down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one!  On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it! 
What is a meth lab, anyway?
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. 
You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't have guys to question now, because you killed them all!
We're sorry.
Then hit the showers, all of ya!
Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
It'll get better, guys.
Better how, dude?
Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?
Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover. 
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.
No. 
They're dead!
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
Dance? Anyone like a dance?
Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
...I think I have a better idea.
Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
Certainly.
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy Club. Please put your hands together for Johnny Manymoons! 
What is Native American comedy, anyway?
Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
What, What did you say?
I said I wanna leave.
Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 
What?? No, no, I mean, I-
Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
Native Americans. 
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
Yeah!
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
Dog parade?
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
Woohoo! Yeah! 
What the hell are they doing??
Well your way of life is about to change, little boys. Now move! 
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy.
What?! Get the hell out of here!
Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.
Hey dudes. 
What a dork!
What?
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. 
Hi Mom, Hi Dad!
HAAAAAA!!!  Kyle! What's happened to you??
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
You guys look pretty gay.
Thanks.
GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 
Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
Dude! W-what are you doing?
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
He's not our friend. 
Stan? 
Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! 
No! Ah!
Kyle! What happened to you?!
I got beat up at school... for being different.
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
No! For not being a metrosexual.
Here I come! 
Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
Gah! Just leave me alone! 
You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.
GRRRRR!!
Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps. 
That does it! I know what I have to do! 
Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! 
One ticket to New York, please.
You're going to New York alone?
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.
Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?
Kyle, what are you doing here?
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
What?? That's what I'm doing!
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
I thought of it first!
No you didn't! No you didn't!
Did so! Did so!
I thought of it yesterday!
I thought of it two days ago!
Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.
Cool.
Carol?  Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas. 
Clear!
Now you know the truth!
They aren't gay? Then what are they?
We are the Crab People!
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Crab People!
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket. 
No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!
Yes! They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
Mom!
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 
God-damnit!
Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
Our band should play Christian rock! 
Christian rock?!
Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
You're on, fat boy!
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
What a stupid asshole!
Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.
Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
It wasn't your life yesterday. 
Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
The answer is no, Kyle.
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
Kyle, don't belittle your own people!
Aaaargh! 
Hey dude.
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
Really?
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
What the hell is that?
I don't know.  Let me go check. 
Kyle, what did you do?!
I don't know!
Well done!
Um, sir-
Shiut up!!  You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downlaoded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.  Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool. 
What's the matter with him?
This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.  Come. There's more.  Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything?  Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free.  The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
That is the folly of man. Now look in this window.  Here you see the loving family of Master P.  Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia. 
So, he's gonna get it, right?
(Yeah)
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
Oh yeah.
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
Oh hey guys. How's it going?
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
Yeah, if we all give in now, people might never stop downloading our music for free!
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?
That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."
What??
"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
Is this for real?? This is for real!
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars.
Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
Yeah, yeah.
Oh.
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
Welcome to the presentation ceremony for Faith Plus One.  And now to present the award, here's Michael Collins. 
This is the worst day of my life.
Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations!
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
Dude, look!
What is that?
I don't know.
GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!
Dude, is that your dad?
What is he saying?
I can't understand him.
Get over there! Stay low! 
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 
Aah! There's another one!
God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!
Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
We can't fight them, Cartman.
No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
Country Kitchen Buffet?
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Yeah, I remember hearing about that.
Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
Who's joking? 
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
You have AIDS?
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
Who said I'm inviting you? 
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
I have never been a dick to you.
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
Okay, except maybe for that one time.
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
Sorry, my mind's made up.
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
Hi Kyle. 
That isn't it, Cartman.
What isn't it?
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
...I don't understand the difference.
I know you don't. 
Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 
Hey Kyle.
Well?
Well what?
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
Good.
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
Oh God, oh God!
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 
Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
Oh. Thanks, dude.
Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
Oh wait. Cartman.
Yes?
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
All right, let's go.
Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
Oh Butters!
Aw dude, weak.
Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
Really?
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.
Oh, awesome.
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 
What?
Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 
What?
But... Casa Bonita.
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! 
It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
Cartman!
Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 
Cartman! 
Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!
Jesus Christ! 
I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!
Oh, dude, what a little asshole!
Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? 
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.
What are they doing?
They're just standing there, talking. 
What happened? 
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
Let's go.  Our faces are painted. 
Wow!
Yeah! All right! 
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
Butt out! Yeah yeah! Kids, that cigarette butt is gross!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go! 
Oh no...
B to the U to the T to the T to the O to the U to the T to the C to the I to the G to the A to the R to the E to the T to the T to the E! Butt out, cigarette!
Dude, this is unbearable.
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
Aw dude, this is really hard.
Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 
Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 
D'awww sick! 
Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 
Oh God... 
Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
Yeah. This is really their fault.
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
Who's Rob Reiner?
Yeah, that must be it.  The tobacco companies, with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings,  they're the ones making music wanna smoke!  They're the ones hurting our nation's health! I will not stand by and see the children of America corrupted by those bastards!  This is war!!
You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
Yeah, what's the problem?
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
Butter!!  Hello South Park!!  It is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health! And I'm gonna help ya!  These poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco. So I say, "We fight fire with fire!" We're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down! 
Oh no...
Got it! 
But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
Isn't he awesome, you guys?
What??
The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports.
So, tobacco helped to build America.
And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965,  when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about.
That sound perfectly reasonable.
Here you go Bob.  This is Mr. Baffrey. He does all our Photoshop work.  Now, all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes into your hands!  And bingo! When this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed! Hahahaha! 
But dude, you're making stuff up.
God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
Huh?
This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
What are you doing? 
Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
They're going to kill me! 
Who's going to kill you?
Well, get away from us then.
Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
You guys have to help me!
No dude, get away!
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
Oh all right.
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
Why?
Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
God-damnit! 
Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay!
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
Yup.
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
No.
Well, I guess we learned our lesson.
No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 
What a whore! 
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
Why?
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
...Go away.
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
God, what a fag!
Dude, not now! 
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you.
What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
Do it!
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
Hi guys. My name's Porsche.
Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
Can we go, please?
Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 
No, dude, I feel worse!
Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
What are you doing?
All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. 
Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. 
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
Yeah. She is.
For sure.
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
Hey, can I join in? 
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
I gotta go tinkle.
No Ike! Shh!
No!
Ike's not my little brother anymore?
Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
We're going to take good care of him.
You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Guys.  Guys, I need your help.
Sure dude.
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
What?
Cartman, calm down!
Is that true?
This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
No business... Christmastime come anda nobody wanna eata Chinese food. Looks like I might as well close.  Oh boy! Some business!  Finally!  Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease!
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease.  Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease?
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a rot of money... hmlet's she. How many people?
Four.
Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a rot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred daura.
How about fifty daura?
Fifty daura?! You flighn to Canada cost at reast three thousand daura!
Fifty-five daura.
Hey! Stop wasting my time wa fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!
Okay. Sixty daura.
Sixty-two daura.
Okay.
Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.
Got it. 
(Me neither!)
Why not?
('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Rooking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright. 
All right! We're going to Canada!
Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to refrect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you bereive in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one. 
Hey, where the hell are you going?? 
Do something, Kyle! 
I'm trying! 
Eh-xcuse me?  Uh, is this an invasion?
No.
Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion! 
Hey! We're in Canada!
What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
Who's that?
God, what a dick!
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa. 
So how do we get to Ottawa?
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
Word!
Ahoy there, travelers.
Who are you?
You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.
French Canada?
Well first you must answer that phone.  Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
We don't have time for this.
You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call!  Ring-ring. Ring-ring. 
Hello?
How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!
Okay, you can come with us.
Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away.
Can we just get going, please?
How could you be so stupid!
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!
Well come on! 
Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister. 
Do you think we can still make it in time?
Yes?
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? 
No. No!! 
Yes?
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye!
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here.
Really? 
I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?
Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
Not so fast! 
Ike!
Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
And we can't perform sodomy, eh?
But why are you making such strange laws??
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
I am the Prime Minister of Canada.  I can do whatever I-  Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend.
What the hell??
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
Dude, come on.
Lin
Stop it, Cartman!
Pfaha, so funny. 
Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 
Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
Wow, cool.
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
Kiya! Kiya!
Kaii yo! 
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)
No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 
I still say this is a bad idea.
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
But don't tell anybody we have them.
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
That doesn't count, fatass!
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
Who the hell is that?
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Whoa.
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 
God dammit Cartman!
Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
It hurts! It hurts! 
Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
Dude, shut up!
I agree with Cartman!
What?!
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
God dammit!
God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
Oh no.
Shut up, Butters!
That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
Wuhuff, woof, woof.
We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! 
Oh shit, somebody's coming!
Quick, hide Butters! 
You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! 
He said, not now, Craig!
Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
I swore to never fight again.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 
Oh no. Butters!
Lose who?
Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
Butters!
Butters!
Butters!
Dude, look! 
Why bad?
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.
Yeah, we know.
Butters!
Butters!
Butters! Where the hell are you?!
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 
What?
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
Screw you, fatass! 
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
It's Butters! We saw 'im!
Where?!
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
Then it's not too late!
Butters is right on the other side.
We have to get past them!
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
You have that power too?
Oh, Jesus.
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
Just run with it, dude.
Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
...You're an asshole, Cartman.
You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
What?
So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
Oh no. Cartman, no!
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Why?
Because! 
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
God damn you!
You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
What?! 
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
Enter. 
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
Go on, Kyle.
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
I came here to talk about you!
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
I'm a Vulcan!
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
No! I'm on the away team too! 
It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
Yes. A little too quiet.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
No it doesn't. 
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
He does not!
How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
Naw uh!
(Me too!) 
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
People don't hate the Jews!
Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
...You're a stupid asshole! 
Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
One please.
This is an R-rated movie.
Yeah, I know, but I have to-
But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it.
...Thanks. 
Wa! 
Haaaah! 
Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!! 
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Faaart.
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
You were, you were right?
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
You were right. 
Kill him! Guilty! Kill him!  Kill him! Kill him! Die!
Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! 
And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
...What is troubling you, my child?
Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Ah! You mean he's a Jew!
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.
But how can the Jews make it better??
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement.
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 
Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation. 
Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
Whatwhatwhaaat?!
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
I saw The Passion!
You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. 
Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
Yeah! Yeah!
No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
How dare you?! 
Look out!! 
Yeah...  I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!
Dude, what's wrong with him?
You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?  Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
Hey, who are those kids? 
Come on y'all! 
...What the hell just happened?
Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?
Yeah.
All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 
Dude, that is a sweet RC car!
You want a little more, homeboys?
We're not interested, thanks.
Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served! 
Yeah! Go Stan!
Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! 
All right Stan!
Wha?
Yeah! You got served!
Yeah!
That's right!
AWESOM-O will answers the door. 
What the hell are you doing, fatass?
Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
Why?
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
Why?
Yes, of course. 
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
Hey Look! 
Hello! 
Hey. Do you live here?
No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?
Here I am, Blanket!  Heeee!  Jeh chabee durtah!  Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
What's wrong with his face?
Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?  Come on, let's climb the tree!  Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree! 
Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key.
Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.
Won't you imagine along with me?
Mr. Jefferson? 
They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
...I've got time. Do youuu??
Dude, what happened to your knee?
I fell down.
Mr. Jefferson!
Choo-choo train.
Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 
Ow!
I know, I know. Be cool.
Thank you. That already feels better.
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
And where is your mom?
I don't have a mom.
You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
No. I was made in a laboratory.
What?
My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
So you never met your mom?
No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
Jesus Christ! 
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
Hi, Stan.
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
I know. He's here.
What?!
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Come on, Blanket. 
All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore! 
That poor kid.
Hi guys!
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?  Wee, look! He can fly!
Jesus Christ, dude!
Stop, you fucking lunatic! 
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!  I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!  But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!  Oh, I'm melting!
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 
Hi guys! 
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 
Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastard! 
Nooo! 
Come on!
Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!
Hang on, Blanket! 
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.
All right! Things just might work out!
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
Dude, I'm takin' a break.
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
Dude. 
All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.
What?!
"Vvut."
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
They took our jobs!
Aw, dude. 
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.
This is really gay.
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
It is not!
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Dude, I really don't care. 
That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
Huh?
You hate Butters.
Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
You misled him, fatass!
Yeah! ...What's this for? 
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
A giant douche.
Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?
Giant douche.
Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
A giant douche.
Ohhh, we lost?
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche. 
Go, giant douche!
Yeah!
Cartman? What the hell?!
Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! 
Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
Giant Douche is your man!
Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
I'm not voting!
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
I guess... 
Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
Okay. 
Woah... wait, what are you doing?
I'm voting.
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
Yeah, I know.
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. 
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
Oh, no! Noooo!!
Ha! You lose, fatass!
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
Whoa, awesome!
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
You only need one copy, r-tard!
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 
Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.
Why, Mr. Farkle?
I can't compete with Wall-Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet.  I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work.
Cartman, stop it!
I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town. 
See?! That sucks, dude!
What? That's called progress, Kyle.
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
What the hell? 
Butters? 
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.
But you run the Wall-Mart.
Not so loud! It can hear you.
You hate Wall-Mart, too? 
I think it's best we try to reason with it.
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
Oh, awesome! 
How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.
But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. 
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Nuh-uh.
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along" or something.
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
All right, fine. Come on, fatass! 
Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
I heard that!
You heard what?
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
Dude, come on!
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
Dude, we have to go!
God-damnit! 
Goddamn, that took a long time.
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
Can I help you?
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.
We want to talk to who's in charge.
We... invented the Wall-Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low.  We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control.
So how do we stop it?
There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart.
The heart of Wall-Mart?
Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.
All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 
That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
I knew you were!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
No, you didn't.
Yes. I did! 
...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 
We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 
Save it, Grandpa!
We've gotta find the television department. 
Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 
I think I see the television department in the back!
Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far. 
Who are you?
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Where's the heart?
Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!
The question is, "Where is the heart?"
Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?!  Now you shall see my true form!  Now you see me as I truly am!
We'd better get out of here. 
Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now! 
How did you do it, Kyle?
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
Duh.
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
Okay, hang on a second I-
Right now, goddamnit!
All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?
(What?!)
Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!
Yeah! He just got paroled!
Oh, no! No!
Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
Yeah.
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
Dude, let's play Fireman.
Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.
Jews can't be firemen.
Shut up, fatass!
But how do we start a fire?
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
What do you shitheads want?!
Do you know how to start a fire?
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
We're firemen!
Wow, cool!
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
We're heroes!
We saved the school!
Dude, we are in so much trouble!
My mom is gonna break my legs!
No!
Not us. We're good kids.
You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better all pray! 
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
Hey, look! 
Dude, we shouldn't be here!
Help?! 
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
You're gonna have to do better than that, Fourthies!
Well...  Well, what do you want?
Then we aren't helpin' you!
Wait! We'll do it.
This is hopeless!
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
What else has big round squishy globes? 
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
All right, fine. 
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
(Oh yeah!) 
God, I hope this works.
Oh yeah, those are so hot.  Oooohhh
Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
Naw.
We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us.
Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! 
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
So you're gonna help us?
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 
No! You've gotta listen to me! 
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show.
What?!
Hey, Craig, over here!
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Cuuute.  Super cuuute.
Gah, I just don't get it.
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
Good!
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
We're making the news more appealing to students.
I knew we could do it!
We beat Close-up Animals!
Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
Thee... uhhh. What if the-?
We have crab people. Just sayin'.
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
Cough medicine?
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
How do we know which one to use?
Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas.
It's not?
No! What you want is Calminex PM.  It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses.
Oh, okay.
Jesus. 
All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?
Oh dude, I just got the best idea
Me too. 
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
I could watch this for days. 
You guys. You guys, wake up! 
Ah!
Huh?
Butters, get away from me!
I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
Jesus, you may be right.
Well I... we...
So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings!
Twenty-two people?! All right!
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
Dude, bail?
...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
What's going on?
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
Do it! Do it!
Those wings don't look very strong.
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
Awww, go on and do it already!
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
Cartman, what did you do?!
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
You don't have any powers!
Wuh be careful, Kyle.
He can't do crap!
Which can only mean one thing!
Ha! You see?!
That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
What?!
Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene. 
This is fuckin' ridiculous!
Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? 
Hey! What about this guy?!
"Junior, what are you doing out?" I'm sorry, Mother. "You come home right now and have sex with me!" No, Mommy! 
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.
How do you know?! Are you psychic?!
No.
Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again! 
Why won't anybody listen to me?!
(Don't take it personally, Kyle.)
I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
There has to be another way!
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
Butters, Goddammit.
All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 
Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?
I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
Then let this be our final battle! 
Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
Hi there!
What the hell?
How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
Aww, but why?
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
But does that mean you aren't baptized?
No. I'm Jewish.
You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
Huh?
Oh. Hiya, Stanny!
Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.
No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
What?! Kyle?!
With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
Dude!
Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
Oh, stop it, Cartman! 
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Dude, why do you care?!
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
Yeah yeah, come on! 
All right, fine!
"Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later. 
Goddammit, Cartman!
Dude, don't be nervous.
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 
All right boys, now you're all here because you're the best of the best.  I know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far, so let's get out there and  SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT!  Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it?
Yeah?
Can we talk to you for a minute?  You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya?
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game.
Oo whataya mean?
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
I know. I deserve it.
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class! 
Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.
Yeah. That's right.
They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?
Totally! I totally understand!
So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery.
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm.
Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty.
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
...You what?
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!
Yeah! 
Oh, so is that it?!  You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag! 
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
What??
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
Absolutely not, Kyle!
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
Yes, but Kyle-
Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
But Jews can't play basketball! 
Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
Did it hurt?
Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 
Jesus Christ, dude!
Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
Come on, Kyle, we should get going!
Alright, Dad! 
Welcome to the All-State Basketball Playoffs between the best fourth-grade players from Colorado and the best fourth-grade players from Wyoming. 
Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
Who are you?
Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
Well, you're tall and black enough. All right, Broflovski, suit up!
All right!  Dad, I can play! 
Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens.
I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 
All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession.
All right!  Ow. Hm. 
Stop the game! 
I got it! I got the ball. 
Let's get you two up to the clinic and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee.
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
Yeah, this will be a great place to spend spring break. 
Hey, let's ask them. 
Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?
Wha- whataya mean?
We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.
Ugh! Those dirty liars!
Right, so how do we get back at them?
Yeah, we're pissed off.
I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Yeah!
You said it!
Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?
Yeah, it's called a town.
Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
You're doing what?
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
Hold it right there, Kyle! 
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
Probably.
Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
Can I talk to you?! 
I'll I'll call you back, Abe. 
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm making it look like important people call us.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
...well Token doesn't know that.
Yes he does!
How?!
Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 
Welcome to the team, Token.
You were awesome, Token!
We knew you could do it!
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
Twenty dollars.
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.
Mister, you can't do this to us!
So unfair... so unfair.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
Yes. They say it pays a thousand dowar.
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
There it is! American Idol contestants!
Jesus, we made it just in time! 
Yeah. So do we! 
Oh crap!
No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
Aw, just forget it! 
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
What do you mean your client isn't coming?! We're taping the show tomorrow! Where am I goin' to find another contestant? Fine! Go screw yourself!
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
Great! You kids just saved my ass! See you over at Stage 6. 
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Come on, Wing!
Let's do it Wing!
Awww! 
Oh my God, dude!
You guys, you guys!
What?
(What?!)
Get out!
That's four hundred for us! We did it! 
Woohoo! Yeah!
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? 
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
Wing? Wing?
Wing?
Wing? Here, Wing!
Wing?
Oh no!  Hey! That's our client! 
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Two four nine all right, this is the place.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
You tell 'em, Kyle!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
What the hell is that?! Go! Go! 
Dude, maybe we should give up!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
Cartman! 
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
This woman has a contract with us! We own her!
She had a contract with us first! We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Her life belongs to us!
Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Yeah.
Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
It's a lousy business. I quit.
Me too.
Send a cress in your plates, folks? 
Token?
Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!
Wuh what'd I do?
"Congratulations! You have reached ...level nine!"
Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."
No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will.
Kenny had a will?
Oh wow...
That's... really touching.
Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital! 
Oh my God! 
Kenny?
Kenny! You're alive!
Um, it was um, this one time...
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
He did not!
Did so!
Did not!
He's right in here.
Cartman!
Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.
Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?
That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
The tube has been removed?
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time.
Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
Yeah, come on! 
The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention.
We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
Tomato!
Kenny! Kenny!
Oowhoops
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
You mean, Cartman's side is right?
Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
Yeah.
Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.  Keanu Reeves' statue.  Congratulations. 
This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
Just look at those boys out there, lovin' the great game of baseball like we did when we were kids. 
Aw God, I'm so borrred. 
Aw Jesus, not again.
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
We're done! No more baseball!
No more boring baseball until next year!
Post-season?
Nobody said anything about a post-season.
This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
I know we can lose if we try.
You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
Yeah!
You hate this game too?
I don't think so! There's no way you can lose to us! We're going doowwn! We're gonna get creeaamed!
No, we're gonna get creamed!
No way! I'm striking out!
Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
Safe!
Crud! 
Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game! 
We're so proud of you kids!
Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball!
What?
Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible. 
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
But who?
I know who.
Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, from New York City. 
I'm baaack!
There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas.
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.
You're the best!
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz. 
Where do I stand?
R-right over here. 
Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma. 
Yeah! All right!
Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!
He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!
Oh Jesus!
We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket. 
Run kid, run!
Oh Jesus! 
Aw crap! 
I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!
Safe! 
Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody! 
Yaaay!
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
Strike 2!
Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting.
Come on, Dad! Get up!
Get up! You have to fight! 
South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins! 
We... We lost.
Dude, where is she? We can't wait.
God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
Mom!
She's here!
She's got Colonel!
I want some!
All right.
Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
Okay, this is everything, mom. 
All right, let's eat Colonel! 
Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
The skin's the best part...
I can't believe that fat asshole!
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
Yes, but he thrives on that.
(Fuck yeah!)
That sounds great!
Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
Here you go.
Thanks. 
Cartman isn't our friend anymore. 
We're ignoring him.
Ignoring him? How come?
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
Just the good times.
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
Who was that?
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
(Me too.)
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long
I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah!
Huh wuh, what's the matter?
Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!
Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.
Huh?
Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
How do you know that?
Because, I know what did cause the flood.
George Bush?
No.
Terrorists?
No.
Communists?
No.
Chinese radicals?
No.
...Cartman?
...sort of.
Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
How?
Hey, we'll take it!  Over here, yes! Thank you! Thank you!  Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's a LOT better.
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  "Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."
Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
Help! Help! 
Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!
Not so fast, Kyle.
What are you doing?
Hand over the gold!
What gold??
You know what I'm talkng about!
No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
Guys, come on! 
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
I want... your Jew gold! 
...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!
Ohhh, fuck it!
What are all you guys doing here?
How do you know?
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
Good man. Any luck here?
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
Light as a feather, stiff as a board! 
Jesus, what are they doing in there?
You mean it?
Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.
Come on, we gotta go check on him. 
Can you see anything? 
I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
Wait! I don't wanna know that!
You shut up, asshole.
I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
Think of the power!
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
Jealous of what?! I'm doin' this out of principle! To protect the sanctity of marriage!  Fags are gettin' married over MY DEAD BODY!! 
Hello? Oh hey dude.
So, what are you and Wendy doing?
Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
Uh huh...
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe! 
Why?
Hoh now, what makes you say that, Wendy? I'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine...  And if not, we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, won't we?
Who?
Never mind, just carry on, children. Just carry on as two reckless little boys will.
Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
Why do you say that?
It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
That's because I was pissed off!
At who?  Heh- hang on. 
I wanna see my egg.
Huh?
I want to see my egg.
Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!
Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.
Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
Don't let anything happen to it, please. 
Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Two boys can't possibly take care of an egg!
Dude, it's totally fine.
Day five. I made it!  Hello?
Dude, did you hear what's happening?
What?
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
Governor's office?
She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
Impress Wendy??
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
What the hell are you talking about?!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Stan?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.
Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
I don't. She's totally lame. 
Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
Huh?
It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
Come on, buddy, let's go! 
Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
Yes, what is it?! I'm a little busy!
Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
What?? Y-your... you're too late!
Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
Well it's here! You'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked!  Haha, anyhow, as I was saying, we put one egg into the hands of two male students. 
Thanks dude! 
Jesus Christ!
Keep running! 
The the egg that the two boys were given just-
Hang on! Wait! 
Noo! Noooo!!
Gays can get married? What??
Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 
What did we do?
Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles."  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
What?!
Aaaah.
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
Ho! Daywalkers!
This is all a bunch of crap!
Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!
Fine, I will! 
Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 
Stupid supremacist asswipe!
Dude, what's the big deal?
What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
Hello?
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
What? Heh, hello there, kids.
We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
Thanks, Mom and Dad.
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
No... no, I'm sure they do.  Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started.
I just had a couple more questions about-
Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene.  I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason. 
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
That was a very informative speech, Kyle.
Thanks Butters
You buying school lunch today?
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! 
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
Hey.  That's a great idea!
(What's a great idea?)
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
Sure, for what?
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?
Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
Is that an umbrella you're using?
Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
What do you mean, Kyle?
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
That's fine, just get it out of the way...
Dude, this is going awesome.
Right. And you're a ginger. 
Dude, check it out. 
Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. 
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
Red Power!
I don't believe it.
Red Power!
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
Wirha! atta!
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
Huh? Why?
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)
Are you in?
(Hehe, yeah, heh) 
Oh... hey there. 
You guys... need... anything? 
Let's just... let's just walk this way. 
More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
Yeah, good idea. 
(AH!)
Kenny!
Laaa la, laaa lala.
In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
Kyle. Kyle, wake up.
Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 
Cartman?
Oh Jesus, I should have known!
Daywalker!  Throw him in!
Cartman! I need to tell you something!
Go on then! Say your last words!
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
HA! Saving money, duhhh! 
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.
Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 
Yeah. See ya. 
Yeah, yeah!
Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
What secret truth??
I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
I didn't know you were depressed.
I'm all wet! Sweet!
Dude, Jambu is the best! 
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
Why?
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
Killer. 
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
Hello, little boy.  You like my flippers?
Who said that?
I did.
No way!
This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?
South Park.
It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?
What do you wanna talk about?
Let's talk about rocket ships.
Rocket ships?
Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. . You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship.
Why? Aren't you happy here?
I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
What?
Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!
(What the fuck are you talking about?)
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
Dude, he's back, he's back! 
Goddammit, say something!
Please don't call me stupid.
Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see.
Sick?
I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.
Oh my God...
I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform.
That's terrible!
Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick.  Can't. Talk. Any. More. 
Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
Well okay! Let's do it!
The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.
Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
...So it's true.
Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
...What do we do?
Stan? 
Craig, Token, get the slings ready. 
Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
Hello? Hello, this is Russian President.
Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
Yes, we certainly do!  What were you looking for?
I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it!
You can? Awesome!
It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars?
Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
...What?
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
What happened?
They want twenty million dollars.
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!
All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?
I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. 
Okay ma, thanks! 
Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves.
Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
I'm going as fast as I can.
Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
We're busted. 
Huh?
Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.
You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
Everyone down on the ground. Now!
No! Please, we have to go!
You're not goin' anywhere! You're in a lot of trouble! 
But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them!
All right!!
That whale belongs to a sea park!
It belongs with its family!
Where are you taking the whale?
Tijuana, Mexico!
Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck. 
You're going home, Willzy-x! 
Get them!
Willzy-x, I think we're here.
Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
Come on, guys! 
Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them! 
Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
Oh crap! There's more of them! 
Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x! 
Oh my God!
We did it!
Yeah, me too. 
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
Mina-san! You all needu more disciprine!  True disciprine... come from within. We are out of time. I will see you on Tuesday. 
Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
Wait. Where's my Dad?
He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 
Are you sure you're all right?
Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 
Dude, I think you're being followed. 
Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole!
No, dude, it's the police. 
Dude, what the hell is he doing?
I think his pants are falling down.
You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
